Competing for this chicken and white wine market is the newer OpenAir cinema at Birrarung Mar, a fabulous park by the river in the city. [0] The city fosters art and is art; the city creates the theater and is the theater. [1] In fact, the first supermarket pre dated widespread car ownership and originated in an urban area.
