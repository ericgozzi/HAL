[8] Anyone can do it a skyscraper based on the Chinese pagoda and/or a Tuscan hill town. [9] The city fosters art and is art; the city creates the theater and is the theater. [10] The skyscraper has reestablished the pedestrian, him alone.... [11] A theater and exhibition hall are superimposed over the world of the restaurants.
