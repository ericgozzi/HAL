      "Cleaner engines, therefore, might reduce emissions; they also encourage us to increase car usage. [0] The whole body of the flower begins to come into view. [1] Light was the matter of cinema too. [2] It makes copyable documents and home cinema film. [3] \"In the age of speed, the skyscraper has petrified the city. [4] We can leave the theater now... [5] Fields of LEDs began to take over and transform the roles of the movie poster, the theater marquee, the billboard, the cornice inscription, and even the entire urban facade. [6] The end report also recommended extending meter hours, and only allowing cars to park for four hours. [7] The new laws, called Zone Green, allow greenhouses to be erected on roofs, along with solar panels and wind turbines; they also promote gardens and local food production, and in general address the wider needs of retrofitting the city, of making greener the city we have in hand. [8] Anyone can do it a skyscraper based on the Chinese pagoda and/or a Tuscan hill town. [9] The city fosters art and is art; the city creates the theater and is the theater. [10] The skyscraper has reestablished the pedestrian, him alone.... [11] A theater and exhibition hall are superimposed over the world of the restaurants. [12] None of the city’s many subway lines came anywhere near Southie, and its denizens had become as car dependent as any suburbanites. [13] It was a car that promised comfort; indeed, luxury. [14] Perhaps the gloss of a beckoning fruit obliterates and outshines any blemishes that, the apple once eaten into and its core now perching exposed on the sideboard, conspire to make it look rotten, or if not rotten then at the very least spotted with flaws. [15] In this way the district round the skyscraper is cleared. [16] Competing for this chicken and white wine market is the newer OpenAir cinema at Birrarung Mar, a fabulous park by the river in the city. [17] And finally a theater for two hundred and forty spectators. [18] So I snatched it from him, and he wept and said, “O youth, this apple is my mother’s and she is ill. [19] \n",
