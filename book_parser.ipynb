Is the posthuman predicament not also linked to a post theory mood? For instance, Bruno Latour (2004) not exactly a classical humanist in his epistemological work on how knowledge is produced by networks of human and non human actors, things and objects recently commented on the tradition of critical theory and its connection to European humanism. \n",
