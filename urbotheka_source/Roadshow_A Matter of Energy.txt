\page A Note on the Text\
The contents of this book are based upon a filmed conversation between\
Howard Burton and Nick Lane in London, England, on October 11, 2016.\
Nick Lane is Professor of Evolutionary Biochemistry at University\
College London.\
Howard Burton is the creator and host of Ideas Roadshow and was\
Founding Executive Director of Perimeter Institute for Theoretical\
Physics.\
\page Introduction\
The Big Picture\
While many scientists welcome the opportunity to engage the public with\
their work, most don\'92t write popular books about it. There are many reasons\
for this, ranging from the fear of trivializing subtle technical concepts when\
rendering them in everyday language to a broader philosophical belief that\
the advocacy of specific scientific views should best be left to designated\
academic mechanisms like peer-reviewed journals.\
For most, however, the major stumbling block to writing popular accounts\
of their work simply boils down to a question of time, aware as they are that\
the act of conveying advanced scientific concepts to a general audience\
requires a tremendous amount of effort to do it properly. Given the many\
priorities and demands on her time that an active researcher has, the\
decision to refrain from writing popular books is eminently reasonable, but\
the natural upshot of this is that the domain of popular science is principally\
left to a combination of \'93professional popularizers\'94 who aren\'92t themselves\
engaged in any real form of frontline research and retired authorities\
looking to cement their scientific legacy. Both can certainly be interesting\
and worth reading, but neither is likely to give you a clear sense of what is\
actually happening in today\'92s laboratories and why.\
But then there is UCL\'92s Nick Lane, author of no less than five highly\
detailed popular books on evolutionary biology and the specifics of energy-\
conversion mechanisms in biological organisms, who consistently refers to\
himself as a biochemist and a writer. How is it possible that Nick can be\
such an exception to the rule?\
Well, one key factor, it seems, is that he had a different sort of scientific\
career trajectory from most, one where the act of writing played a\
significant role for him relatively early on. After completing his PhD on\
specific aspects of the bioenergetics of mitochondria in an effort to improve\
organ transplantations, he found himself uncertain about what to do next.\
So far, so normal. But then things took an interesting turn.\
\'93I had wanted to do a postdoc, but I had entered a writing competition\
while I was doing my PhD and I happened to be a runner-up; so, I\
\page thought, Well, maybe I can write, then.\
\'93But I had no idea how to go about writing. So, Hooked in the back of\
New Scientist for jobs\'97either a postdoc, ideally something to do with\
bioenergetics and mitochondrial function but nothing to do with\
transplantation, or a writing job\'97and I happened to get a writing job\
before I got a postdoc.\
\'93It was for a small, medical education agency\'97I had no idea such things\
existed\'97and it was basically soft marketing for the pharmaceutical\
industry, but it was goodfun. And it was, in retrospect, very worthwhile: I\
learned to write that way and I learned to communicate with very\
different audiences.\
\'93I realized that you could become an \'91expert\'92 in areas you knew very\
little about, relatively quickly. Now, for me there was a key common\
factor: for so many of these diseases that I couldn\'92t spell one day, it\
turned out that when you read about them you \'92d discover that free radical\
biochemistry was central to the disease process, so Ifound myself quickly\
on home ground.\
\'93This was really the motivation for writing books down the line: that all\
of these different diseases seemed to have the same basis in chemistry as\
to why they were going wrong. So that was thrilling, actually. \'94\
Eventually, however, the desire to focus on this exciting insight naturally\
clashed with the requirements of the rather more prosaic requirements of\
the corporate world.\
\'93After a couple of years it was really enough, because you had to hop\
whenever the client said, \'91Hop \'92\'97there were always subjects that you\
didn\'92t choose yourself and you never had time to follow through in the\
kind of depth that you might want to. So I became almost desperate to\
build on that, somehow\'97and the ideal way out for me was to write a\
book that tried to address the deeper, intellectual question of why this free\
radical biochemistry is underpinning all of these diseases: examining\
what was really going on there. \'94\
That first book, Oxygen: The Molecule That Made the World, successfully\
launched Nick as a writer, so much so that for a time it looked like he was\
going to forever leave science itself.\
\page \'93I had an honorary position at UCL, so I still had a connection with the\
lab, which was a very useful address for me to have. I published\
occasional papers and was writing feature articles for Nature, New\
Scientist and so forth. I\'92d written another book, Power, Sex, Suicide:\
Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life, and that was pretty successful in\
a small kind of a way, I suppose; but I was particularly keen to be\
addressing these big questions.\
\'93I had really developed a lot in how I was thinking over that period of 5\'97\
6 years or so, and it was clear to me that there was a limit to how much\
one can write for Nature or New Scientist about the same theme: you can\
do it once every couple of years, perhaps, but they don\'92t want to have an\
article from the same writer on the same subject every three or four\
months.\
\'93So I was faced with a choice: either I was going to become a journalist\
and write about other people \'92s work and other people \'92s interests or I had\
to get back into research and really follow through with the kinds of\
questions that I was becoming more and more interested in. I tried to\
engage other researchers to do some experiments and to begin to test\
some of the ideas I had, but I realized that there was no way of making\
sustainable progress there\'97people, obviously and reasonably, have their\
own interests and their own drives. \'94\
Finding himself on the outside looking in, increasingly viewed as \'93a science\
writer\'94 by his colleagues rather than an active member of the establishment,\
the opportunity to cross the boundary, as it were, back to frontline research\
seemed increasingly remote. And then, suddenly, a sort of miracle: the\
powers that be at UCL decided that a conscious effort was required in order\
to trigger risky, potentially game-changing ideas that otherwise wouldn\'92t be\
considered in the naturally conservative environment of standard academe,\
developing a specific mechanism, the UCL Provost\'92s Venture Research\
Prize, to shake things up for innovative, unorthodox thinkers.\
In 2009, Nick won. And suddenly, he was back in the club, actively\
pursuing his agenda of demonstrating the overarching importance of\
looking at an enormous range of key biological questions\'97from the origin\
of life to diseases\'97in terms of fundamental energy-transfer mechanisms.\
\page But through it all, he kept writing: Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and\
the Meaning of Life was followed by Life Ascending: The Ten Great\
Inventions of Evolution, which was followed by The Vital Question: Why Is\
Life the Way It Is? His next book, Transformer, is due to be released in\
2021.\
Why does he keep going? Well, partly, I suppose, because at this point\
being a writer is now an essential aspect of who he is. But partly too, it is\
because the very act of writing clearly helps him sort out his research ideas.\
\'93One of the great things about having written books and thought about\
this broader picture, is that I now have what I hope is a very solidly\
grounded picture of how these things fit together across a large scale;\
and this has led me to conclude that the answer has to be in a certain\
well-defined area. Maybe I\'92m wrong in the details, but I\'92m convinced that\
it has to be there somewhere. Ifind that that \'92s true of a lot of these types\
of questions: people who are in a particular field and are not taking that\
broader, synoptic view will tend to compare different ideas solely on their\
own perceived merits or demerits: \'91This idea has these strengths and it\
has those weaknesses, and that one has these strengths and those\
weaknesses \'92.\
\'93But the reason that I think the answer lies there has got nothing to do\
with the quality of the science in the other fields, it \'92s got everything to do\
with the philosophy that \'92s associated with the very notion of life itself,\
leading me to ask, \'91Well, these proton gradients across barriers are so\
fundamental to life that they must have arisen early; and they must have\
happened in an inorganic context originally, so what could that inorganic\
context possibly be doing? \'92\'97a question to which there \'92s only a very\
limited number of answers.\
\'93So whether or not it works for me in the lab, I\'92m confident that it will\
work\'97that having a broader view can funnel you down into a particular\
question; and even if the evidence for it at the moment is weak, which it\
is, I think 10 years down the line, the evidence for it will be strong. And if\
it \'92s not, then I\'92ll be out of a job. \'94\
Well, maybe one job, anyway. But quite likely not that one either.\
\page The Conversation\
\page I.	A Long and Winding Road\
Nick goes round the houses\
HB: I\'92d like to start with your early years and how you got into science.\
Were you always interested in biology or even science in general?\
NL: I was always interested in biology and chemistry, but I\'92m rather upset\
that I was put off physics at school.\
HB: When did that happen?\
NL: At a very early age\'97about 13 or 14.\
HB: Was it a specific teacher?\
NL: It was partly the teacher and it was partly the manner in which the\
subject was taught; and the kind of physics that I\'92m really interested in now\
we never even touched on at school. As a result, I didn\'92t do physics at A\
level, which I now really regret, because it would have been\'97well, it\'92s one\
of my main interests right now, but I never had a formal grounding in it.\
At any rate, biology and chemistry, from the very beginning, were\
subjects that I really loved and I found I was quite good at. It\'92s strange,\
because I was quite good at English and writing as well, but I never did\
nearly as well in the exams; and that was, in part I think, because I never\
knew what they were looking for as an answer.\
Science is very straightforward in that sense: the answer is plain\'97at least\
it is in exams, anyway. But meanwhile, I think that writing books has\
helped me to find my way of addressing problems in science, realizing that\
the exam-type of answers in science\'97where you\'92re either right or wrong\'97\
is actually not really true at all; and it took me a long time to really\
understand that, which was as much through writing books later on in life.\
HB: Was science encouraged in your family?\
NL: Well, my father is a historian and my mom was a primary school\
teacher. My mom had a deep interest in science but never really studied it in\
a serious way, and my dad is very intellectual and probing in the way that\
he addresses questions.\
\page Actually, I\'92ve often found that, evolutionary biology is not a million\
miles away from history in terms of how it structures thinking about a\
question. The actual approach to gathering data or formulating hypotheses\
is very different, but there\'92s a lot of interpretation that goes on in\
evolutionary biology which is essentially historical, and I think I get a lot of\
that from my dad.\
HB: He must have been quite pleased by watching your career and\
trajectory as you moved forwards.\
NL: Well, my trajectory has been rather peculiar; it\'92s worked out very well\
\'97 so far anyway\'97but it\'92s not a normal trajectory. I was outside science,\
technically, for some years, writing books. I would love to be able to\
recommend that to people, because it certainly expanded the way that I see\
science and I think it\'92s, in fact, very important, to have a very broad view\
which you can focus down onto particular areas, which is not the way that\
most people operate.\
If you go through a standard degree and focus on a PhD and so on, you\
become narrower and narrower, but I followed a path that I don\'92t really feel\
I had much to do with: I just did what seemed the best thing to do at the\
time; and I\'92ve been all around the houses.\
HB: Let\'92s talk about that in a little bit more detail. You did an\
undergraduate degree in biochemistry.\
NL: Yes. Which I really did not enjoy. At school, I was massively keen on\
biochemistry and evolutionary biology and desperate to go to university and\
study it, but I found it a bitter disappointment. It was probably partly me, it\
was probably partly that I also left home and found a freedom that was\
important to me: I spent a lot of time climbing and hitchhiking around and\
telling stories to people. That was good fun\'97and, in retrospect, important.\
I also found the course, and perhaps the way that undergraduates are\
taught generally in universities, very constrictive. It was a lot of memory\
work, a lot of rote, a lot of exams. And now, looking back and thinking how\
I teach undergraduates and how one should teach undergraduates, all of that\
memory rote learning has got nothing to do with how science works, how\
research works or whether or not you\'92ll actually be a good scientist.\
\page It put me off; and it wasn\'92t until I started doing a PhD\'97and that was,\
again, a series of lucky accidents, really\'97I would have left science if I had\
anything else to do at that point.\
But when I started doing a PhD I realized that research was just\
wonderful; and, since then, I\'92ve been going in a more conventional\
direction.\
HB: It\'92s interesting, because my experience partly reinforces yours and\
partly doesn\'92t, insofar as high school biology was looked upon\'97by myself\
and others I hung around with at the time\'97as deadly boring and nothing\
more than rote memorization.\
My thinking at the time\'97and this turns out to have been a remarkably\
common view that I discovered after having these sorts of discussions with\
other physicists\'97was that because of that, biology was not only boring, but\
also considerably harder than physics, which was a particularly formidable\
combination for the lazy teenager that I was.\
The sense was that in biology you were forced to memorize all these\
arbitrary things whereas, in physics you only had to know a couple of basic\
principles and you could derive everything and didn\'92t really need to\
memorize anything at all, so it was ever so much easier.\
And then there was this aesthetically-pleasing notion of understanding\
things as a consequence of first principles, which you seem to be very much\
in favour of as well.\
NL: Yes, that\'92s how I come at all these problems in biology: it\'92s very much\
from first principles, which I suppose is something of a physicist\'92s\
approach. Actually, a lot of my PhD students are physicists, so there\'92s\
obviously something going on there.\
HB: That sounds quite reasonable to me. I\'92d like to get back to your career\
trajectory but, before I do, a specific question: you mentioned the\
difficulties associated with the undergraduate experience, both from a\
student and teacher perspective, but did you have a particularly influential\
high-school biology or chemistry teacher?\
NL: Yes, I had several, very good teachers in chemistry and biology, and\
other subjects beyond that, like history, English and maths. But the two who\
really stand out most in my memory are the biology and chemistry teachers.\
\page I very often regret that I haven\'92t gone back often enough to say thank\
you, because teachers set out your life for you in a way that they probably\
never appreciate\'97well, they may know that they\'92re doing that, but I doubt\
that they ever know just how much they influence particular people\'92s lives.\
HB: What was it about them that made them special? What sorts of things\
did they do? How did they engage with the students in a way that was\
helpful or captivated you?\
NL: You would hang onto every word of the chemistry teacher, and it was\
partly that he put things in an extremely interesting way. It was also partly\
that, if you were not really focusing, he had an extraordinary shot with the\
board duster: it would explode right in front of you and you would get chalk\
in your face. So, you really did focus on his lessons, otherwise you were\
getting an explosion of chalk in your face\'97I suppose it was a mixture of\
the proverbial carrot and the stick, but it meant that you really focused in\
his class.\
HB: It was efficacious, anyway.\
NL: Yes.\
HB: OK, so let\'92s get back to your story. After you finished your\
undergraduate degree you weren\'92t terribly inspired by the experience, as\
you were saying, so what happened next?\
NL: I needed to pay off my student debt, and I got a job in a lab that came\
with the possibility of doing a PhD if I wanted to. I didn\'92t intend to do that,\
but when I realized how much fun research was, then I really did want to do\
it. So, looking back, I\'92m enormously grateful for that opportunity.\
The guy who gave me that opportunity is quite a maverick, a guy named\
Colin Green\'97my PhD was funded by his winning on the horses for a short\
period. It would be very difficult to do that sort of thing today; it\'92s become\
far more formalized.\
Talking to various academics at UCL and elsewhere, almost everybody\
had a slightly unusual ride in one way or another, different to what we\
expect our own PhD students to do. I think that we\'92re beginning to lose that\
freedom to be a bit different, to do things in a different way.\
HB: A bit of rebelliousness, almost.\
\page NL: Yes, exactly. It\'92s a shame if that goes, because I think it\'92s an important\
part of being a good scientist.\
HB: Right. Let me ask you specifically about your writing. You\'92ve written\
many books\'97you clearly have a passion and a gift for writing\'97and earlier\
you mentioned the benefits of writing, enabling you to take a broader\
perspective on things. Did this interest in writing come naturally, as it were,\
or was it more as a result of what you were reading, you think?\
NL: When I was at school, I read books like Richard Dawkins\'92 The Selfish\
Gene and James Watson\'92s The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the\
Discovery of the Structure ofDNA. I read popular science books avidly at\
that age and dreamed, as most kids do, of Nobel Prizes and doing\
something really valuable and important\'97and that all kind of drained out\
of me at university.\
Then later, doing the PhD, well, that was different. It concerned a very\
specific question related to organ transplantation\'97the bioenergetic aspects\
of it\'97how the energy works in the mitochondria, which are the\
powerhouses of cells. If you take an organ out and store it on ice for two or\
three days and then transplant it back into someone, there are two problems\
which arise.\
One of them is that you have a potential for rejection and the other one is\
that, as soon as the oxygen flows back in with the blood again, then the\
organ is likely to go wrong: it\'92s called ischemia reperfusion injury and that\
was what my PhD was about.\
So, it was strongly geared towards solving a problem, a very specific\
problem to do with kidney transplants, and one that would make quite a\
difference in the world if you could do it because we can only store these\
organs for two days, at the most, in the case of kidneys; for a liver or a lung\
it\'92s a matter of hours.\
So I was quite driven to find a solution, and the reason I ended up leaving\
science again was that I never did come up with anything like a solution. I\
had a great time doing the research, but I didn\'92t get anywhere close to\
where I wanted to be with it, and I needed to leave that field because it was\
plain that I had become stale\'97I didn\'92t have an alternative view of it.\
HB: I see. And then from there you became a professional writer. How did\
that happen?\
\page NL: Well, I had wanted to do a postdoc, but I had entered a writing\
competition while I was doing my PhD and I happened to be a runner-up;\
so, I thought, Well, maybe I can write, then.\
But I had no idea how to go about writing. So, I looked in the back of\
New Scientist for jobs\'97either a postdoc, ideally something to do with\
bioenergetics and mitochondrial function but nothing to do with\
transplantation, or a writing job\'97and I happened to get a writing job before\
I got a postdoc.\
It was for a small, medical education agency\'97I had no idea such things\
existed\'97and it was basically soft marketing for the pharmaceutical\
industry, but it was good fun. And it was, in retrospect, very worthwhile: I\
learned to write that way and I learned to communicate with very different\
audiences.\
A lot of it was doing animation of the mechanism of action of drugs, so\
you would have to set things up by saying something like, \'93Here\'92s what\'92s\
going wrong with neurons in the brain as one degenerates in Alzheimer \'92s\
disease, and here\'92s how this drug interacts with that picture\'94.\
You would have a 10-15 minute, 3D animation of this process. I would\
write the narration and envision the camera angles, and then work with an\
artist and a producer and animator to make these things. It was great fun. It\
would be different jobs over different weeks; I would put in proposals for\
new work.\
HB: It was probably quite a learning experience too, I imagine, in many\
different ways. There\'92s learning about how to write effectively and reach\
your audience, but if you\'92re bouncing around from topic to topic\'97doing\
Alzheimer\'92s one day and something else the next\'97you must have had to\
read up on quite a wide variety of different things.\
NL: I realized that you could become an \'93expert\'94 in areas you knew very\
little about, relatively quickly. Now, for me there was a key common factor:\
for so many of these diseases that I couldn\'92t spell one day, it turned out that\
when you read about them you\'92d discover that free radical biochemistry\
was central to the disease process, so I found myself quickly on home\
ground.\
This was really the motivation for writing books down the line: that all of\
these different diseases seemed to have the same basis in chemistry as to\
why they were going wrong. So that was thrilling, actually.\
\page I also had to learn to write for an international audience where English\
was generally the second language; and that means cutting out any flowery,\
verbose English and writing not only plainly and clearly, but also in a\
continuous forward-moving direction.\
Because you can\'92t set it out as you would in a scientific paper saying,\
\'93Well, it could be for this reason or that reason\'94. You can\'92t have a\
discussion that flows sideways, if you like; instead you have to say, \'93This\
leads to this, leads to this, leads to this\'94, because the camera is tracking\
that.\
That forces you to tell a straight story; and that was also an interesting\
learning experience. So, I learned a great deal from that experience. But\
after a couple of years it was really enough, because you had to hop\
whenever the client said, \'93Hop\'94\'97there were always subjects that you\
didn\'92t choose yourself and you never had time to follow through in the kind\
of depth that you might want to.\
So I became almost desperate to build on that, somehow\'97and the ideal\
way out for me was to write a book that tried to address the deeper,\
intellectual question of why this free radical biochemistry is underpinning\
all of these diseases: examining what was really going on there.\
HB: That\'92s interesting, because I had naively assumed that your present\
\'93bioenergetic focus\'94, as it were, was the natural result of your exposure to\
mitochondria as a PhD student, reflecting on the broad-based impact of this\
wonderful ability to convert energy in a very efficient way.\
NL: Yes: it took me a lot longer. I had my first intimations, when I was\
working with this medical communications agency, that free radicals really\
were important; and that the kind of chemistry and biology that I knew\
about underpinned an awful lot and was worth trying to explore further.\
But I didn\'92t really know why or how; and it wasn\'92t until I started writing\
my first book, Oxygen: The Molecule That Made the World, that any of this\
really came to me. It was the process of writing the book that gave me\'97I\'92m\
not really sure I can say \'93deep\'94 insights\'97but a far deeper, broader-based\
understanding of the world than I ever had before.\
HB: Describe a little bit of the sociology of the field to me. I say this as a\
complete outsider; but my sense is that when you take a \'93big picture\'94 view\
of biology, a large chunk of that these days consists of people looking at\
\page things from the perspective of genomics and how the vast amount of\
resulting information associated with that can be recognized and understood\
\'97both independently, as it were, but also in terms of how the resulting\
protein processes and so forth interact with the surrounding environment.\
And here you come along saying something like, \'93Well, that\'92s very\
important, of course\'97indeed, essential\'97but it\'92s not the whole story; we\
also have to look at things more from a bioenergetic perspective, because\
that imposes essential constraints on these other factors and it\'92s deeply tied\
to them.\'94\
Were there\'97are there?\'97other people thinking along those lines, or does\
this put you somewhere near the fringes?\
NL: There are some people thinking along these lines, yes, but not many.\
Probably the person who\'92s influenced me most\'97I first met him some years\
later, after I\'92d written that first book on oxygen\'97was a guy named Bill\
Martin.\
Now, he is really a geneticist by background but, unlike most geneticists,\
he\'92s extremely interested in biochemistry and physiology and what genes\
really do in the context of what they\'92re doing it in; and he\'92s surprisingly\
unusual in that.\
He has enormously sweeping and inspiring ideas about the evolution of\
life. The first time I met him I thought he was completely mad. I didn\'92t buy\
his ideas at all; and now, I do. It took some time to come around to them\
because they were so radically different.\
I met him outside a conference hall; he was about to give his talk in a few\
minutes and he was having a cigarette outside. He\'92s a big, brash Texan guy,\
and I remember that he was trembling a little bit\'97he was obviously very\
nervous\'97which seemed surprising to me given that he didn\'92t look like the\
nervous type.\
And then he got up and gave this extraordinary talk, in which he argued\
that the Bacteria and the Archaea emerged separately from hydrothermal\
vents and that those first cells didn\'92t have cell membranes as we know them\
\'97the whole thing was almost impossible to take on board, it was just so\
utterly different to anything I had ever heard before; and by then I had read\
widely about early, evolutionary history.\
HB: What was the reaction by others at the talk?\
\page NL: Stunned silence, really. I mean, he\'92s quite an abrasive character and he\
has a knack of making enemies even of his friends sometimes; and that\'92s a\
real shame because he\'92s a wonderful man.\
In short: these ideas were right on the outside of a normal place to be, but\
they\'92re very solidly grounded in what we do know about biochemistry and\
physiology and genetics \'97so I think he\'92s right.\
It took me a while to see the world from closer to his point of view\'97and\
it\'92s not as if we share all our thoughts on it even now\'97but he\'92s probably\
the one person who has taken a similarly broad bioenergetic view of the\
whole sweep of evolution.\
HB: Very good. I\'92m almost ready to go into those details, but before I do\
let\'92s get back to your story to bring things up to date. I left you, as it were,\
after you wrote your book, Oxygen: The Molecule That Made the World.\
What happened after that?\
NL: Well, throughout this whole period I had an honorary position at UCL,\
so I still had a connection with the lab, which was a very useful address for\
me to have. I published occasional papers and was writing feature articles\
for Nature, New Scientist and so forth.\
I\'92d written another book, Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the\
Meaning of Life, and that was pretty successful in a small kind of a way, I\
suppose; but I was particularly keen to be addressing these big questions.\
I had really developed a lot in how I was thinking over that period of 5-6\
years or so, and it was clear to me that there was a limit to how much one\
can write for Nature or New Scientist about the same theme: you can do it\
once every couple of years, perhaps, but they don\'92t want to have an article\
from the same writer on the same subject every three or four months.\
So I was faced with a choice: either I was going to become a journalist\
and write about other people\'92s work and other people\'92s interests or I had to\
get back into research and really follow through with the kinds of questions\
that I was becoming more and more interested in.\
I tried to engage other researchers to do some experiments and to begin\
to test some of the ideas I had, but I realized that there was no way of\
making sustainable progress there\'97people, obviously and reasonably, have\
their own interests and their own drives.\
\page HB: So, you found yourself on the outside looking in, and you had to find a\
way to get back inside.\
NL: Yes. And at that time\'97this was 2008\'97UCL announced a very unusual\
prize that was called Provost\'92s Venture Research Prize that was available\
for any researcher within UCL.\
It was couched in very grand terms\'97Potentially transformative ideas\
that change the way we think about an important idea; Nobel Prize-\
winning-type ideas\'97but I think most people saw it simply as potentially\
mad ideas that are unlikely to get funded by the research councils.\
And if you see it in those terms it changes your perspective. So rather\
than thinking, I don't have any ideas on that sort of grand scale, you instead\
say to yourself, \'93Well, mad ideas that are unlikely to be funded\'97I have a\
whole book full of those\'94, it helps.\
I figured I had nothing to lose and everything to gain from this, so I put in\
a short proposal\'97it was literally one page, which was all that was asked for\
\'97 and it bounced back to me from the guy who was running it, Don Braben.\
Don was of the opinion that the peer review process for proposals was\
killing really innovative, breakthrough-type research, because the people\
who review it, being your peers, have invested their whole careers in a\
particular way of seeing the world.\
He\'92s thinking about major, major breakthroughs\'97people of the calibre of\
Einstein and Planck and so on. He believes that there have been several\
hundred of these over the 20th century, people who just see the world in a\
different way but who, now, would be killed by the modem approach of,\
You've got to get the backing of your peers to get X amount of funding\'97\
they simply would not have survived in that kind of environment.\
I think he\'92s probably right, actually; and this was his attempt within UCL\
to try to back that kind of research.\
HB: So, you wrote this one-page proposal.\
NL: Yes. And then he came back at me with all sorts of criticisms and\
comments, saying things like, \'93Address these, and we can talk again\'94. It\
was a very iterative process: I met him on three or four occasions, and each\
time, he batted me back with a whole bunch of problems and questions.\
Eventually the proposal swelled to about 20 pages, by which time he said to\
me, \'93Okay, I think you've answered all of my questions and Pm willing to\
\page back you, but nobody\'92s going to read this proposal: get it back down to four\
pages and someone might read it\'94.\
Then it went to David Price, the director of research across UCL. I had an\
interview with him and then with the Provost himself. At no point was there\
a conventional peer review process, at no point was I interviewed by\
biologists who had any kind of vested interested in this.\
It\'92s not, in fact, a million miles away from how universities appoint staff:\
people give seminars and then have an interview with a panel, which is not\
made up of experts in that particular subdiscipline, but clever, experienced\
types who, between them, can more or less cover a range of ways into that\
person\'92s subject.\
And from that one can usually judge reasonably well, I think, whether or\
not someone is any good or whether the ideas are coherent. So, I don\'92t think\
this approach is actually very far away from the mainstream in many ways;\
and it shouldn\'92t be.\
HB: Well, kudos to UCL for doing this, because in my experience so many\
institutions become, to some extent, the victims of their own success: once\
they develop a large reputation, the price all too often paid for that\
reputation is a sense of conservatism, an increasing amount of\
unwillingness to ensure that anyone outside of the mainstream who risks\
sullying that reputation is kept outside.\
That UCL is exhibiting an explicit willingness to shake things up and\
thereby countenancing the possibility of involving people who are not\
necessarily already within the establishment or the mainstream takes a good\
deal of courage, foresight and independent thinking. Very good for them.\
NL: Absolutely, I hugely benefited from it. And you\'92re right: this scheme is\
not running in any other university in the UK.\
HB: Do they still do it?\
NL: Yes, absolutely: it\'92s a unique place. The fellow who\'92s really running it,\
Don Braben, is always willing to meet people. He tends to bat them away;\
and if they keep coming back, he keeps batting them away until he becomes\
convinced that the person has an idea that\'92s really worth something.\
HB: OK, but that strikes me as an important part of the process too\'97not\
only to sufficiently convince him, but to ensure that the person is\
\page sufficiently tenacious and determined, while being flexible enough to listen\
to what a knowledgeable and objective person has to say about their ideas.\
NL: Yes, that\'92s right. And the ideas have to be open-ended; it\'92s not like\
testing a particular hypothesis that could have a yes or no answer at the end\
of it, it\'92s really about a particular way of seeing the world that could change\
the world.\
I mean, to put it in its simplest terms: energy and enthusiasm matters too.\
And that can\'92t possibly be wrong, can it?\

\page II.	Structuring Energy\
Cells, membranes and a counterintuitive mechanism\
HB: So this seems an appropriate moment to turn our attention to The Vital\
Question and exploring that big idea you were talking about in more detail.\
Let me start by giving you a brief precis of what I took away from the\
book as a complete non-specialist and you can tell me if I\'92m right or wrong\
before you go into various aspects of the details.\
The book captivatingly engages right from the beginning by focusing on\
\'97 somewhat unusually for popular science books\'97open questions: that is,\
what we don't know rather than what we do.\
So here is my sense of some of these open questions and the way\'97or at\
least one way\'97you suggest we go about addressing them.\
We are in this situation where we have three fundamental types of cells,\
and every living being around us is made up of one of these three types.\
Two of these three are called \'93prokaryotes\'94\'97Bacteria and Archaea\'97and\
one open question is understanding how, exactly, they are related to each\
other. Meanwhile, there\'92s the question of how the third type, a more\
complex type of cell called a \'93eukaryotic\'94 cell comes into being in the first\
place. The standard story seems to be that these prokaryotes were around\
for a few billion years doing their thing and then, suddenly, these eukaryotic\
guys show up, and it\'92s quite unclear how that happened, exactly.\
Then there\'92s a more general question related to the energy process in all\
of these types of cells. It seems that they are all effectively powered by\
something called proton gradients\'97protons across membranes\'97and there\
are a bunch of related questions associated with that: Why is that? Why is\
this so remarkably universal? What is this telling us about the underlying\
processes that give rise to what we call \'93life\'94?\
In particular, one related aspect to focus on is the question of stability,\
both in terms of this energetic process itself and the lifeforms associated\
with it. The very fact that we have bacteria still around four billion years\
later seems quite telling.\
In short, the idea seems to be that focusing on the specifics of this energy\
mechanism, these proton gradients, will allow us to more concretely address\
and hopefully understand these larger issues.\
\page That\'92s my sense of things. That\'92s what I picked up.\
NL: That\'92s a very good synopsis.\
HB: Okay, good, so I haven\'92t completely struck out. I should add\
parenthetically that this is undeniably a great book that I would\
wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. Go buy it.\
OK, end of advertisement. Now it\'92s over to you to sketch out the main\
arguments before I ask you more questions about things.\
NL: Sure. So the book is called, as you mentioned, The Vital Question, and\
the subtitle is, Why is Life the Way It Is? That\'92s really what I have in my\
mind as \'93the vital question\'94, but it\'92s not obvious from the outset what that\
question actually means.\
What it means is that all complex life that we see around us\'97plants,\
animals, fungi, basically everything that you can see\'97is composed of a\
very particular cell type; they\'92re large, complex cells with all kinds of bits\
and pieces inside that they share.\
If you look at one of our own cells down a microscope, you would\
struggle to tell the difference between that and the cell of a mushroom or a\
plant outside the window: they\'92re remarkably similar. You could list page\
after page of the detailed traits that they have in common.\
And that\'92s very, very different to the structure of either Bacteria or\
Archaea\'97this other type of prokaryote. Archaea are small, simple cells\
that, like Bacteria, don\'92t have a nucleus. They look like Bacteria but, in fact,\
in their genes and their chemistry, they\'92re actually quite different.\
HB: You mentioned that they\'92re named wrongly too, because you\'92d\
naturally assume that they were the oldest things around.\
NL: You would think so; and that\'92s why they were named that way\'97but\
they\'92re almost certainly not any older than Bacteria; they\'92re probably about\
the same age.\
Life on earth has had a very peculiar trajectory: it started very early, so\
far as we can tell \'97about 4 billion years ago\'97and then we had, as you\
mentioned, this 2 billion year delay before anything really interesting\
happened\'97interesting at the level of large, morphological complexity.\
Then, this one cell type arises \'97once, it seems to have happened once in\
4 billion years\'97and we have this enormous explosive radiation of the\
\page major different groups of eukaryotic cell types: not only the plants, the\
animals, and the fungi, but also thousands of single-celled things like\
amoeba\'97that\'92s where the real variation within the eukaryotic world is\'97but\
they\'92re all basically the same cell structure.\
The things that we have in common are things like sex, for example\'97\
having two sexes\'97and going around and engulfing other cells and eating\
things and so forth. These are all traits that all these cell types seem to\
share, and it\'92s not obvious why none of them arose in Bacteria or Archaea.\
And it\'92s also not obvious if it would necessarily be this way on another\
planet.\
So here I\'92m approaching the physicist\'92s view again, as you mentioned\
earlier: trying to predict from first principles what we might expect to see as\
life on another planet.\
Some of it is straightforward \'97 M>rM it be carbon-based and need\
oxygen?\'97but some of it is quite strange: Would it be sexual?\
We don\'92t know. It\'92s a 100-year-old problem of why life is sexual on\
earth; and the strange thing is that entire field, for 100 years, compared\
sexual organisms with asexual organisms\'97things that clone themselves,\
like dandelions and other plants and animals.\
It turns out that if you clone yourself you can grow much faster and do\
much better for a period of time but then they all fall extinct. And it\'92s never\
been entirely clear why they all fall extinct, but it seems that there\'92s just a\
lot less variation in them, so they\'92re far more likely to get wiped out by a\
virus or something.\
HB: Right. But let\'92s return to this \'93first principles\'94 perspective you were\
talking about a moment ago. It seems to me that the obvious question is\
this: despite the fact that when we look around us we see such enormous\
diversity in species and subspecies and all that, nonetheless all these wildly\
different life forms all seem to be composed of essentially these same type\
of these eukaryotic cells \'97so why is that? What\'92s going on?\
NL: That\'92s exactly it, that\'92s this vital question. Now, what\'92s going on?\
In a very short answer, what I think is going on is that Bacteria are\
simply structurally constrained: they\'92re very small, simple cells and they\
breathe, in effect, across their membrane. They breathe through their skin\
while Eukaryas don\'92t\'97we\'92ve internalized it in mitochondria, which were\
Bacteria once.\
\page So, some prokaryotic cell swallowed another prokaryotic cell, and the\
long-term effect of that was that it was breathing internally\'97it had\
internalized the whole respiration process. But it\'92s not very obvious why\
that would make such a big difference, or why bacteria can\'92t just do that\
sort of thing without first swallowing a cell.\
Now, the swallowing the cell, I think, is the critical factor\'97it\'92s not so\
much about one cell, actually. There\'92s a lovely quote from the French\
biologist Jacques Monod, who said that, \'93Every cell dreams of becoming\
two cells\'94.\
Cells just become populations\'97most people have seen populations of\
bacteria dividing away madly. So, you have a cell within a cell, and it very\
quickly becomes a population of cells within a cell; and they compete with\
each other to get into the daughter cell\'97into the next cell \'97and so on.\
What you have then is a population of living things inside a population of\
cells; and that is probably the single-defining moment of the whole history\
of life\'97which is that, in very simple terms, it changes the selection\
pressures.\
So, what you have to do to survive is not worrying about the outside\
world, it\'92s about worrying about the \'93inside world\'94. It\'92s for those reasons\
that all these eukaryotic cells have got all the same traits, because they were\
all dealing with this same problem very early on in their evolution: How do\
I deal with the population of bacteria that\'92s going to tear me apart if I\'92m not\
careful? How do I constrain it? How do I keep it doing useful things for\
me?\
HB: Right; and perhaps I\'92m mixing metaphors a bit, but to me this whole\
approach of distinguishing between \'93inside\'94 and \'93outside\'94 necessarily\
brings up this whole notion of a membrane: right from the beginning, as it\
were, you are looking at things from a \'93membrane-centric perspective\'94 as it\
were.\
NL: That goes right back, again, to the origin of life, because Bacteria, as I\
say, are respiring across their outer membrane\'97we\'92ve simply internalized\
all of that, along with the genes needed.\
There\'92s a lovely quote from what you might call the \'93founding father\'94 of\
bioenergetics as a field, a guy named Peter Mitchell who won the Nobel\
Prize in 1978, and he had a paper on the origin of life in 1957 at a\
conference in Moscow.\
\page I probably won\'92t be able to remember the quote verbatim, but he was\
essentially saying that he sees life as being the dynamism of things crossing\
the membrane, of phases on opposite sides of the membrane; and you can\'92t\
really tell the difference between what\'92s the \'93inside\'94 and what\'92s the\
\'93outside\'94\'97they\'92re simply two phases on opposite sides of a structure\
which is both separating and uniting them.\
When you begin to see the world in that kind of way, and you think about\
the structure of hydrothermal vents and you think about the structure of\
energy flow in living cells, you realize that it\'92s an extremely productive way\
of seeing the world.\
HB: Okay, so I\'92d like to discuss these hydrothermal vents and all that in\
more detail later, but first I\'92d like to focus on the act of cellular respiration\
and this \'93proton-motive\'94 force.\
As I understand it, all of these three different types of cells we were\
discussing earlier undergo some form of this respiration. And from a\
chemical perspective, what it amounts to and what it, basically, amounts to\
is, from a chemical perspective, stripping electrons from food.\
NL: Yes. We basically have a current of electrons in the membrane stripped\
from food and passed to oxygen, so we literally have a current.\
HB: And that current that\'92s created is what is responsible for pushing\
protons outside of the membrane.\
NL: Yes: that current is driving the extrusion of protons across the\
membrane. And then we have something like a hydroelectric dam, where\
the membrane is the dam, and we\'92ve got a reservoir of protons on one side\
of it.\
And then there\'92s the turbine in that dam, which is the ATP synthase, the\
energy-generating protein. It makes ATP, which is often called the \'93energy\
currency\'94 of life, but you could really think of it as just cash to spend on\
things\'97\'93energy cash\'94.\
HB: OK, fine. So I\'92m coming to a question\'97just bear with me. Part of my\
problem is that I don\'92t understand any of the details, which is a decidedly\
less grandiose way of expressing things than saying that I\'92m a \'93big picture\'94\
guy-\
\page But anyway, this is what I\'92m thinking. You mention in your book that this\
current can be evaluated in terms of quantum-tunnelling and associated\
probabilities, which certainly seems reasonable to me.\
And that makes me think something like \'93Well then, wouldn't it be the\
case that the strength of this current\'97and the associated effects, like how\
well it pushes protons across the membrane\'97depend on some structural\
aspects of the elements or molecules or whatever that it's tunnelling\
through?\'94\
I mean, I can imagine creating some sort of mathematical model, say,\
when you can say something like, \'93If we space these things at this level,\
they wouldn't be as efficient, if we use this other type of material, it would\
be less efficient or more efficient\'94, or something like that.\
I guess what I\'92m struggling with is the possible variation of efficiency\
within what seems to be a strikingly universal process.\
NL: Well, electrons do hop, by quantum-tunnelling, from one centre to the\
next, and the likelihood of them doing that depends on the distance, so it\
has to be a small distance\'97in the order of 12 angstroms or so.\
So, it depends on that distance. It depends, as well, on the pull from there\
\'97the reduction potential\'97the degree to which it wants that electron; and it\
depends, as well, on whether it\'92s \'93got room for it, chemically\'94, in effect.\
These factors are all under selection\'97you can see that the distances\
between the centres are really the same between wildly different species.\
They\'92re set in very large proteins and the proteins have these three-\
dimensional structures; and within that structure, it has this quantum-\
tunnelling site here, and then maybe there\'92s another protein sub-unit over\
there somewhere that holds the next one back over there, say\'97and what\'92s\
been selected for is that distance between them is 12 angstroms.\
And then there\'92s the thing which is pulling it through and making it hop\
from one site to the next is the \'93sucking power,\'94 if you like, of oxygen,\
which is down at the other end. It doesn\'92t have to be oxygen, it can be\
almost anything\'97iron, or nitrate, anything which wants to grab an electron\
will work\'97it\'92s just that oxygen does it particularly well.\
HB: Right. So let\'92s get back to what you were saying earlier when you\
mentioned the possibility of extraterrestrial life, examining things from a\
first-principles approach where you\'92re effectively trying to distinguish Does\
it have to be this way? Is this part of some type of necessary, guiding\
\page principle for life? from Did it just happen to be this way? Is this a sort of\
accident\'97or at least one possibility out of many?\
So, I\'92m thinking, Why this particular mechanism? It seems particularly\
important to note that all cells are doing this sort of thing, to some extent\'97\
that seems highly suggestive of some kind of universal law.\
NL: Well, the question is, What does it suggest? I don\'92t think we know, and\
this is not the kind of question that many people worry themselves about.\
It could suggest one of two things: it could suggest that it\'92s just really\
good, and so it spreads and it\'92s spread across the whole world because it\'92s\
better than any other way of doing it.\
Or it could suggest that there\'92s a fundamental reason underpinning it that\
it had to be this way and other ways either don\'92t work as well or simply\
never got a hold in the first place. In fact, it\'92s quite possible to think of\
alternative ways of structuring energy.\
HB: Okay, good: that\'92s what I wanted to get to.\
NL: It really does look as if there\'92s a peculiarity about this: it\'92s one of the\
most counterintuitive ideas in biology, one that Leslie Orgel, a famous\
chemist working on the origin of life, called, \'9377ze most counterintuitive\
idea in biology since Darwin\'94.\
It\'92s different to something like DNA, where as soon as you see the\
structure,you understand how it works. And with this, it\'92s just not\
chemistry.\
Everybody thought in terms of chemistry\'97 you want to activate this\
molecule to make it react, so you transfer a phosphate group onto it and\
that makes it a bit more reactive and then it does its thing.\
But nobody even dreamed that the intermediate would not be just another\
chemical molecule, but would be a membrane with an ionic gradient across\
it.\
It\'92s odd; and I think, in a way, that\'92s the joy of the whole thing, because,\
Why is it like that? Is it just an oddity or \'93quirk\'94 of the particular origin of\
life here? Is it something which happened a bit later and spread for some\
weird reason?\
What I\'92d like to think, and what I think is the case, is that it\'92s\
fundamental: that not only does it structure the way that life works here-\
from the origin of life, right the way through this long period of stasis of\
\page bacteria, through to this abrupt, almost unique origin of all complex cells,\
through to all of the complex properties of these cells\'97but that it alludes to\
some general principle that can in some ways explain that whole\
continuum.\
It almost certainly doesn\'92t\'97nothing in science works like that\'97but it\
would be wonderful if it could restructure the way we think about these\
questions; and I think it might.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	To what extent do \'93historical sciences\'94 such as evolutionary\
biology, geology and cosmology fundamentally involve\
different approaches than other areas of science? Readers\
interested in this topic are referred to Chapters 1-2 of\
Astrophysical Wonders with Scott Tremaine and Chapter 8\
of Science and Pseudoscience with Michael Gordin.\
2.	Might our sense of the \'93counterintuitive\'94 nature of the energy\
membrane mechanism described in this chapter be related to\
how we classify phenomena into divisions like \'93chemistry\'94\
,\'93physics\'94 and \'93biology\'94 in the first place?\
\page III.	Hydrothermal Vents\
More than just chemistry\
HB: I\'92d like to take you back to where I cut you off a moment ago, when\
you were talking about hydrothermal vents. My understanding is that now\
we\'92re talking about the origin of life and by \'93origin of life,\'94 we\'92re looking\
at the origin of both these bacterial and archaea cells, because as you were\
saying the eukaryotic cells came a couple billion years later, so we don\'92t\
have to worry about them for the time being.\
Perhaps I can ask you to begin by describing these early experiments in\
the origin of life back in the \'9150s with lightening and a flask of so-called\
\'93primordial soup\'94.\
NL: Well, there\'92s been an intellectual tradition in the origin of life of\
synthetic chemistry and what works, going back to that Miller-Urey\
experiment in the 1950s.\
Even in the 1950s, the idea that the earth was like Jupiter in that it had\
gases like methane and ammonia and hydrogen wasn\'92t exactly discredited,\
but most serious geologists at the time thought that the early earth was full\
of carbon dioxide with those gases never really geologically likely, but\
chemists don\'92t worry about that kind of thing; they\'92re interested in\
chemistry that works.\
And if you start with CO2 it doesn\'92t work: you try to get it to react with\
hydrogen and nothing happens. And that\'92s important to know, because if\
you could make them react, you would be able to strip CO2 out of the\
atmosphere, reversing global warming, and perhaps convert it into synthetic\
gasoline and solve the energy problem as well.\
So, if we could make that work, it would have a massive impact on the\
world, but unfortunately it doesn\'92t.\
Now, it\'92s very difficult to publish stuff that doesn\'92t work. The chemists\
have done wonderful chemistry, starting at first with things like methane\
and ammonia. They accept that the earth probably didn\'92t start that way, and\
so they began thinking about things like cyanide and formamide\'97relatively\
reactive molecules\'97and they have been able to synthesize things like\
nuclear dyads, the building blocks of DNA, from them.\
\page This gives you an impetus, then, because it works: everything looks as if\
it\'92s falling into shape\'97this chemistry will produce the building blocks of\
life; and, sometimes, only those and at quite high yields. It\'92s hard to gainsay\
it, because it\'92s good, experimental science; but it\'92s nothing like life\'97and I\
think they\'92ve been guilty of ignoring biology.\
They take biology into consideration insofar as they say, \'93Okay, we need\
to synthesize DNA and RNA and proteins from very simple molecules. We\
don't know what the early earth was like, we don't know how long a time\
there was between that chemistry and the first cells, so it's intellectually,\
perfectly acceptable.\'94\
All of which is true. But what they\'92ve come up with is a series of\
pathways that just doesn\'92t look anything like a cell as I recognize a cell.\
They haven\'92t really closed the distance between prebiotic chemistry and a\
cell, as we know a cell.\
Now, the reason I became very interested in this is because of these\
alkaline, hydrothermal vents, where you have natural, proton gradients\
across inorganic barriers, so it\'92s very analogous to cells.\
It throws up this possibility that cells have a structure\'97and this is\
another thing that the chemists have not worried about very much; they tend\
to do reactions in a test tube in solution and there isn\'92t structure there\'97but\
cells have a structure: everything is going on across this membrane. And if\
you ignore that membrane, then maybe you\'92ve ignored the most important\
thing.\
Then, the question is, If we're doing prebiotic chemistry, we don't have a\
membrane, so what do we do? Well, what do we have? We have an\
inorganic barrier and fluids on opposite sides which are very different in\
their chemistry and will react if they get in touch with each other.\
HB: So, we have a large-scale analogy, something which looks very much\
what is required at the cellular level.\
NL: Yes, and we have a continuous flow as well going through it.\
The difference between living and not being alive is really energy flow:\
when someone dies, there\'92s really no difference between when they were\
alive and when they were dead except they no longer have any energy flow\
\'97they\'92ve not lost any genetic information in that moment. And this is\
really at the heart of the origin of life: all cells have this continuous energy\
\page flow; and they waste a tremendous amount\'97excretion is massively over-\
looked.\
So there is a continuous, chemical reaction, which is powering\
everything; and just by continuously breathing oxygen, eating food, we\'92re\
putting out waste all the time. All cells do that; and this is what vents do as\
well: they\'92re continually feeding in hydrogen in these alkaline fluids and\
venting out their waste.\
There are various ways in which it\'92s analogous to a cell, but it\'92s purely\
inorganic, so the question is then, Well, how might these forces of chemistry\
and physics be harnessed to driving the growth of protocells, the first cell-\
type things?\
But at least looking at things in this fashion you now have the possibility\
that there may be some way in which these proton gradients across\
inorganic barriers could have led to this mechanism being taken over by\
cells, becoming fundamental to cells, and being used by all cells on this\
planet.\
So there are explanations for why that might work\'97I won\'92t go into them\
in detail now\'97but the key point is that these are testable: there are very\
simple questions that can be addressed in the lab. We\'92ve built a reactor to\
try to test some of them\'97it\'92s very simple, it doesn\'92t cost much, and it\'92s\
pretty amateurish, I have to say\'97but nobody else has ever tried to ask those\
particular questions about the structure and about whether hydrogen can\
convert CO2 into organic molecules if driven by a proton gradient across a\
barrier. So that\'92s the essence of it.\
HB: Wasn\'92t there this guy from JPL... I can\'92t remember his name at the\
moment.\
NL: Mike Russell.\
HB: Right. He had suggested this very idea, if memory serves.\
NL: Yes.\
HB: And incidentally, he seemed to be another one of these cranky,\
rebellious types. Somehow a good many of the colleagues in your field\
seem to often have that sort of profile.\
NL: It does seem that way, doesn\'92t it?\
\page HB: And he had developed this idea before such hydrothermal vents had\
actually been found, right?\
NL: Yes, exactly. Mike Russell had laid out a lot of the theory underpinning\
the idea that these alkaline, hydrothermal vents could effectively be an\
electrochemical reactor for the origin of life. He first started putting that\
forward in 1989 and had a series of papers through the early \'9190s where he\
drilled down into exactly how it might work. All of this was very much on\
the periphery of the field, and it wasn\'92t until the discovery of Lost City in\
the year 2000, that suddenly, it became mainstream: he took on, almost\
prophet-like proportions, as he had predicted exactly what these vents\
would be like.\
HB: Where is this Lost City, exactly?\
NL: It\'92s off the mid-Atlantic ridge. The key point is that\'92s it\'92s not on the\
mid-Atlantic ridge, because these are not volcanic reactions that are driving\
it: it\'92s a reaction between cold rock, in effect, and water, with the ocean\
water percolating down into the crust.\
So, the idea is that it would happen on any wet, rocky planet; and that\
means billions of exoplanets across the Milky Way.\
HB: OK, but that presumably also means that we should have lots more of\
them here. How do you actually go about finding these things?\
NL: Well, this was discovered by accident. We know that the mid-Atlantic\
Ridge is an extremely interesting place\'97lots of expeditions go there. It\'92s\
not easy to get there: you\'92re several kilometres beneath the surface.\
As it happens, Lost City was discovered by an expedition that was going\
to the mid-Atlantic Ridge; and about 20 kilometres away some PhD student\
\'97it was her first trip down, I think\'97looked out of the window of the\
submersible and said, \'93Wow, what's that?"\
Part of the reason that it was discovered so late was that nobody had\
bothered to look. There\'92s a natural tendency to go to the \'93interesting\
places\'94, and you don\'92t really get those kind of vents on the ocean-spreading\
centres where you\'92ve got the magma directly welling up very close to the\
surface, you tend to get them further away. But you tend to get them in that\
region precisely because of the spreading centres: the ocean crust is\
spreading across\'97this is fresh crust, which has been exposed to the ocean\
\page water\'97and it\'92s coming from regions of the mantel, which are quite close to\
the crust.\
So, it\'92s the type of rock that will react with water: it\'92s rich in magnesium\
and iron and things like that and it\'92s basically just reactive.\
Now, if you didn\'92t have any tectonic spreading, then the entire ocean\
crust would\'97the technical term is \'93serpentinize\'94\'97it would react with\
water and turn into a different mineral: it would metamorphose into a\
different mineral called serpentinite, and that would happen down to a depth\
of 5-10 kilometers down and everything would stop, that would be it.\
So, the fact that we have plate tectonics is a necessary condition. We have\
a living planet; and I think it\'92s important to see this continuity between the\
continuous movement of geology and the continuous movement of living\
cells\'97the processes are very similar.\
HB: Very interesting. So the idea is that these hydrothermal vents give you\
something that\'92s similar to this proton gradient that\'92s structurally key for\
cell biology, enabling us to imagine the development of both Bacteria and\
Archaea from there. And what separates Bacteria from Archaea, if memory\
serves, is that they have rather different types of membranes. Is that right?\
NL: Yes. There\'92s a paradox there. There are these two major domains of\
life, the Bacteria and the Archaea. They look the same, they both arose 4\
billion years ago, they both have effectively infinite population sizes over\
virtually infinite periods of time; and yet in their morphology they are very\
constrained: they remain tiny cells without much morphological complexity\
with fairly small genomes and so on.\
And so it becomes an interesting question: What constrains them? We\'92ve\
touched on that already\'97that effectively they\'92re respiring across their\
membrane, and that\'92s what provides the constraints and stops them from\
becoming larger and more sophisticated.\
But we have this paradox about the origin and divergence of the Bacteria\
and the Archaea. We think that the common ancestor was in these\
hydrothermal vents; and we\'92re fairly sure that all the Bacteria and Archaea\
are using proton gradients across membranes to drive their growth\'97so it\'92s\
not just energy metabolism, it\'92s carbon metabolism as well\'97but the thing is\
that they have very different membranes, and so there\'92s a paradox there\
about what kind of membrane their common ancestor had.\
\page Was it one type that got replaced somewhere in the process, or did it have\
something which was different?\
We\'92ve done some theoretical work\'97which would be appealing to\
physicists, because it\'92s basically calculating the proton flux through\
membranes and through the proteins and so on\'97just to work out if it\'92s\
feasible that natural proton gradients could drive these processes in living\
cells, because it\'92s not obvious that they can.\
What you would expect is somewhat different. Let\'92s say you\'92ve got a\
membrane and a turbine in that membrane\'97like the ATP synthase we\
spoke of earlier\'97and you\'92ve got lots of protons on one side and relatively\
few on the other, then the protons will come cascading through until you\'92ve\
balanced the concentration or the charge across the membrane and you\'92ve\
reached equilibrium\'97and then, it will stop.\
This is what most bioenergeticists will say: that it will never work\
because you\'92re always going to get equilibrium in no time at all.\
Now, in a vent you\'92ve got this continuous flow from this alkaline fluid: so\
then the question becomes, What is the rate of flow? Under what conditions\
could it work and when would it not work?\
The long and short of all of it is that it can work very well as long as the\
membrane is really leaky to protons.\
So, they can come cascading through these proteins, but also through the\
membrane, but because you\'92ve got an effectively infinite ocean of protons\
out there, when they come in, you\'92ve still got more to replace them; and\
you\'92ve got a continuous flow of hydrothermal fluids, which is continually\
taken them away as well \'97and so they\'92re flushed out across this very leaky\
membrane.\
So it does work if you\'92ve got a very leaky membrane\'97in other words, a\
membrane which is not like either the Bacteria or the Archaea but an\
ancestor which is simpler and necessarily very leaky.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	In what ways do reflections on the origin of life help yield a\
deeper biological understanding to what life actually is,\
biologically-speaking, and what, exactly, is the dividing line\
between \'93inorganic\'94 and \'93organic\'94?\
2.	What do you think Nick means, exactly, when he talks about\
\'93the continuity between continuous movement of geology and\
the continuous movement of living cells\'94? Might a deeper\
understanding of biological processes inform our\
understanding of geological processes as well?\
\page IV.	Simulations! Challenges\
Making your own hydrothermal vent\
HB: I\'92d like to turn to some of your experiments that you alluded to earlier\
to simulate the processes in these hydrothermal vents. I understand that in\
one of your experiments you\'92ve actually been able to generate\
formaldehyde\'97which doesn\'92t actually mean much to me, I have to admit,\
but might well be highly significant to someone who actually knows about\
these things.\
NL: Well, we\'92re trying various different avenues\'97that\'92s one particular set\
of experiments and that\'92s probably the main thrust. Yes, we have succeeded\
in making formaldehyde\'97that\'92s not a big deal in one sense, but it\'92s a big\
deal in another sense.\
It\'92s a big deal because, as I said earlier, hydrogen and CO2 normally\
won\'92t react with each other\'97you can mix hydrogen and CO2 together in a\
flask and pressurize the whole thing and put a match to it and nothing is\
going to happen\'97but if you can get them to react with each other, then they\
release energy in reacting.\
In other words, there\'92s a barrier to their reaction, but once you\'92ve\
overcome that barrier, then they should react quite readily; and the\
thermodynamics tells you, in effect, that under these conditions, you will\
make cells.\
There will be other barriers as well, but what the cells that live in these\
vents that grow from this reaction do is to use proton gradients across the\
membrane to drive that reaction.\
And the way they do it is to use iron-sulphur proteins. Many proteins\
have an inorganic group right at the heart of it, it\'92s that that\'92s really driving\
the reaction; so the protein\'92s providing the context for it and it\'92s drawing in\
molecules and bringing them in contact in the right orientation with this ion\
cluster at the heart of it.\
These are, effectively, mineral structures that exist in vents. And the\
expectation is they would have been in those early vents and be able to\
drive, catalyze, some of these early reactions.\
\page Now, they do to a point, but if you simply mixed iron-sulphur minerals\
with carbon dioxide and hydrogen, nothing much happens either.\
So the question we had was, \'93Well, is it the proton gradient that makes\
the difference? Is it the structure, the barrier, the fact that you've got these\
iron-sulphur minerals sitting in a barrier with fluids on one side of a\
particular acidity and on the other side a different acidity and the barrier\
acting as a semiconductor, transferring electrons from one side to the other\
side?"\
So that\'92s the setup that we\'92ve tried to emulate in the lab. And it turns out\
that the biggest barrier to the reaction is the first couple of steps to get to\
formaldehyde. It\'92s not that we\'92re particularly interested in formaldehyde in\
itself, but we\'92re wondering, Can we get to the top of that barrier? Can we\
clear the barrier?\
HB: OK, I understand the concept of finding a way to clear an energy\
barrier to get a process going. I\'92m wondering about another issue, though:\
that of timing and efficiency appropriate to these evolutionary timescales.\
I mean, I can imagine someone saying, \'93Yes, that might work in\
principle, but you\'92ve only got a trace amount of what was needed under the\
circumstances\'97you should have had much more. You should have had this\
percentage or that percentage, given the amount of time that\'92s involved.\'94 Is\
that the sort of calculation or modelling that goes on as well?\
NL: No, not for me. Christian de Duve, a Nobel Laureate who worked on\
the origin of life, made a very important point in this respect, which is that\
life is about chemistry, and chemistry happens quickly or it doesn\'92t happen\
at all. If a reaction doesn\'92t happen quickly enough, something is going to\
take away the reactants, or they\'92re going to react with something else: you\
have to have reacting right here and now or it\'92s not going to happen.\
So thinking in terms of millions or billions of years is not actually very\
helpful. It might take millions or billions of years for evolution to happen,\
but most of evolution is about stasis, not about change; and change can\
happen very quickly.\
The fact that Bacteria remain Bacteria for 2 billion or 4 billion years\
doesn\'92t say that they\'92re trying to change, it says that selection keeps them as\
they are; and we don\'92t necessarily know how long it took for the selection\
pressure to change and for complex cells to then arise. The assumption is\
\page that it takes millions and millions of years but it could be tens of thousands\
of years\'97we don\'92t really have a feel for time in biology.\
That goes even more for the origin of life.\
My feeling is that at least producing organics had to happen quickly and\
on a large scale; and any system which is doing that is getting you into the\
right ballpark\'97and then the difficult parts related to self-organization of\
matter come into play.\
For a membrane that spontaneously forms a bilayer, that\'92s quite easy; but\
if you start thinking about the origin of molecular machines, the protein-\
building factories called ribosomes, it\'92s very hard to know how these appear\
in the first place.\
What is selection operating on, exactly, because we have no genes at that\
point\'97so selection on what, exactly? Or is it just some sort of spontaneous,\
self-assembly? In which case, we have the obvious questions, Why this\
structure, exactly; why does it happen to do that job rather than another\
structure?\
HB: Right; and there\'92s also the question about the scale. In your book, you\
gave some anecdotal notion of this by saying, I think, that there were 13\
million ribosomes in one cell, all of which are efficiently producing proteins\
\'97that\'92s just mind-boggling.\
NL: Yes, so there are 13 million of them inside one cell\'97and you can\'92t\
even see the cell\'97but at the same time, if you go down to the level of\
atoms, then these are massive, molecular machines with 60 or 70 moving\
parts\'97and yes, they can make an entire protein in a minute or something\
like that, so they\'92re extraordinary things.\
So these are the real problems for the origin of life that have barely been\
touched on yet. We have no idea how long that will take or how likely that\
is, but one thing you can say for certain is that if you don\'92t start from an\
environment which provides the building blocks for all of that and then\
somehow focuses it in that particular direction, you will never get you there.\
So this chemistry must happen quickly and it must happen well. The fact\
that we can make it happen a little bit in the lab is an encouraging start, but\
we\'92ve got a small reactor and atmospheric pressure in a glass jar and we\'92re\
talking about simulating reactions which should have been going on across\
the sea floor in vents that can be 60 metres tall at high pressures where\
hydrogen dissolves properly.\
\page You don\'92t know what the missing parts are. These are geologically,\
chemically complex systems, all we can do is say, \'93Well, modern cells that\
live there use these iron-sulphur minerals\'94, for example, or, \'93They use\
magnesium to do thisand so we try to use those same things\'97we try to\
reconfigure them from the same ingredients that cells use\'97not the things\
that might work best, but the things that cells actually use.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	Might there be some sort of chemical process which happens\
over very long time scales? What would such a process need to\
involve?\
2.	To what extent do Nick\'92s views on evolutionary processes\
correspond with the notion of \'93punctuated equilibrium\'94 made\
famous by Stephen Jay Gould?\
\page V.	Synoptic Justifications\
Philosophers wanted\
HB: Well, that all makes sense to me given your constraints; and I don\'92t\
pretend to have any knowledge of the differences in scale that arise when\
you have one of these things that\'92s massive with high pressures and all the\
rest, but one thing that did occur to me when I saw this little tabletop thing\
that you had is, Why don\'92t they have big, biological experiments like they\
have big physics experiments?\
NL: We can\'92t agree with each other. I mean, everything I\'92m saying now is a\
point of view which was pioneered by Mike Russell and Bill Martin and\
there\'92s probably 20 of us in the world actively working on these kinds of\
questions, specifically to do with the origin of life in alkaline, hydrothermal\
vents.\
The majority of people working on the origin of life are coming at it from\
very different places; and who\'92s to say who\'92s right and who\'92s wrong? I\
think we\'92re right, obviously, or I wouldn\'92t be here, but they think they\'92re\
right and they may well be right and science is not at the stage yet where we\
can build a CERN or something where everyone agrees on what the\
question is and how exactly to test it.\
HB: OK, but I mean 20 people for this approach? I\'92m sure you\'92re right, I\'92m\
not arguing with you, but that seems odd to me. I can certainly imagine that\
there\'92s a spectrum of different views, but why is that, do you think? Is it\
because people are primarily transfixed with genetic mechanisms, or that\
the chemists aren\'92t thinking biologically, as you mentioned earlier? What\'92s\
going on? Why are there only 20 people, more or less, working on this?\
NL: I think it\'92s precisely that the chemists don\'92t think biologically. They\
think in terms of what chemistry is going to work, and they\'92re not too\
worried about the next steps\'97they\'92re not too worried about how a\
ribosome self-ass enables, say\'97they\'92re interested in whether or not they can\
do the chemistry that can make the nucleotide building blocks; and that\'92s\
enough for one person\'92s lifetime in science\'97it\'92s a difficult question.\
\page Then there are the astrophysicists who are interested in cosmic chemistry.\
It\'92s a fact that meteorites are often chock-full of organic carbon that was\
being delivered to the early earth\'97there\'92s no doubt about that. But the\
question is, Is it meaningful? Did it deliver something that was needed for\
the origins of life or was it incidental?\
My guess is that it was largely incidental, but why should people believe\
me beyond the power of an argument? Science is not about the power of\
argument: science is about the evidence base for the argument.\
Arguments are perceived as dangerous by people\'97I think too much.\
Although a PhD technically means a Doctor of Philosophy, I think there\'92s\
not enough philosophy in science these days, actually.\
One of the great things about having written books, and thought about\
this broader picture, is that I now have what I hope is a very solidly\
grounded picture of how these things fit together across a large scale; and\
this has led me to conclude that the answer has to be in a certain well-\
defined area.\
Maybe I\'92m wrong in the details, but I\'92m convinced that it has to be there\
somewhere. I find that that\'92s true of a lot of these types of questions: people\
who are in a particular field and are not taking that broader, synoptic view\
will tend to compare different ideas solely on their own perceived merits or\
demerits: \'93This idea has these strengths and it has those weaknesses, and\
that one has these strengths and those weaknesses\'94.\
And then you might compare them. So a review of origin of life\
chemistry will cover hydrothermal vents and might say something like,\
\'93Okay, maybe there's something about the structure. It's difficult;people\
have tried to make hydrogen react with CO2 and yes, you get trace amounts\
of this\'94.\
And the conclusion would likely be something like, \'93Well, it's an\
interesting idea, it's experimentally tractable and some people are working\
on it; but there's been a lot more weight of evidence in this other idea\'94', so\
an objective, balanced, overall review would tend to put less weight on\
hydrothermal vents than it would on other environments.\
HB: Well, in addition to this key synoptic feature you\'92re alluding to, it\
should also be mentioned that I suspect part of that is because not nearly as\
much work has been done on hydrothermal vents either\'97it\'92s a chicken and\
egg type of situation.\
\page NL: Absolutely, that\'92s a large part of it. And also because it\'92s not easy for\
these reactions to happen, because nobody\'92s looked at the structure of cells\
and tried to work out whether or not they can be driven to occur.\
But as I said, the reason that I think the answer lies there has got nothing\
to do with the quality of the science in the other fields, it\'92s got everything to\
do with the philosophy that\'92s associated with the very notion of life itself,\
leading me to ask, \'93Well, these proton gradients across barriers are so\
fundamental to life that they must have arisen early; and they must have\
happened in an inorganic context originally, so what could that inorganic\
context possibly be doing?\'94\'97a. question to which there\'92s only a very\
limited number of answers.\
So whether or not it works for me in the lab, I\'92m confident that it will\
work\'97that having a broader view can funnel you down into a particular\
question; and even if the evidence for it at the moment is weak, which it is,\
I think 10 years down the line, the evidence for it will be strong. And if it\'92s\
not, then I\'92ll be out of a job.\
HB: So\'97just to hopefully recapitulate what you were saying\'97if you come\
at it from the idea that this proton-motive force is the most fundamental\
thing, or at least a very fundamental thing, then you\'92re necessarily inclined\
to look at mechanisms that can generate life that naturally have that, first\
and foremost.\
That\'92s your guiding philosophical picture, which doesn\'92t just arrive\
randomly. It came from looking around and saying, \'93My goodness, all these\
cells have this as an essential aspect to them\'94.\
NL: Which is something we\'92ve only realized over the last couple of\
decades, and the more cells that we discover living by very different means\
in very different environments, turn out to have exactly same mechanism.\
HB: Such as these so-called \'93extremophiles\'94.\
NL: Exactly\'97that\'92s right, yes.\
So, the strength of that argument has become enormously stronger over\
the last decade: that this is a fundamental aspect of how cells work.\
None of this is to gainsay the importance of DNA and information, but\
it\'92s just to say that all of that operates within the context of a cell, and cells\
operate within the context of energy fluxes across a membrane.\
\page And that membrane and the proteins involved are so complex that most\
people simply put it to one side and say, "It cannot be ancient because it\'92s\
too complex\'94, rather than saying, "Okay, so what are they actually doing\
and can we conceive of intermediate steps on the way to that happening ?\'94\
That\'92s essentially what I\'92ve been doing.\
So, this overarching synoptic approach makes me feel quite confident\
that there has to be something in it, and it\'92s just a case of how one gets the\
funding to do the experiments and how one physically sets up the\
experiments\'97those are the kinds of questions that I wrestle with on a daily\
basis.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	Do you agree with Nick\'92s statement, \'93Science is not about the\
power of argument: science is about the evidence base for the\
argument\'94? How, exactly, should \'93evidence\'94 be defined in this\
context?\
2.	Should all scientists be required to take a course or two in\
philosophy of science as part of their training? (Readers\
interested in this issue are referred to Chapter 5 of Inflated\
Expectations: A Cosmological Tale with Princeton\
University physicist Paul Steinhardt and Chapters 3-5 of\
Constructing Our World: The Brain\'92s-Eye View with\
Northeastern University neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett.)\
\page VI.	Becoming Complex\
From prokaryotes to eukaryotes\
HB: So at the risk of beating this to death, my sense is that you\'92re focused\
on the fundamental importance of this proton-motive force\'97that\'92s the thing\
that is deeply tied to your entire philosophical approach as a core feature of\
life\'97and you have to find a way to get that to happen. You\'92re focused on\
these hydrothermal vents because you think that they are a prime candidate\
for somehow generating this key cellular mechanism from some related\
inorganic process \'97and tautologically this process has to be inorganic to\
start with, of course, since we\'92re dealing with the origin of life\'97but even if\
somehow these hydrothermal vents don\'92t work at the end of the day, and\
you have to look elsewhere, that hardly invalidates your key motivation and\
overall approach.\
But then there\'92s this second aspect that we talked about at the very\
beginning: once things start and you\'92ve got cells with membranes and\
energy fluxes and all of that, how do we go beyond that and get the\
complexity of life\'97not only the difference between Bacteria and Archaea,\
but also\'97eventually and rather more significantly in my view\'97the\
appearance of Eukarya like us\'97all of these eukaryotic cells with a nucleus\
inside, and all the wonderful biological complexity that springs from that.\
NL: Well, that does stem, in fact, from these conditions at the origin of life.\
Let\'92s say, for the sake of argument, that this what I\'92ve been telling you is\
correct: that the reason that all cells use proton gradients across membranes\
is, in the end, to drive the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen, to\
make organics and to grow\'97it\'92s that fundamental.\
These vents are produced by a reaction between rock and water and\
they\'92re found on any wet, rocky planet and icy moons in the solar system\'97\
Enceladus and Europa and places like that\'97even Mars has these hydrogen-\
producing, serpentinization reactions going on. Carbon dioxide is very\
common in atmospheres of bodies in our solar system, so there are plenty of\
occasions where these reactions can occur.\
More generally, there would be billions of these sorts of exoplanets in the\
Milky Way alone, so you\'92re going to have repeated on billions of occasions\
these occasions where you have hydrothermal systems rich in hydrogen,\
\page and atmospheric conditions rich in CO2 and the barrier to them reacting is\
lowered by the structure of the system\'97that you\'92ve got a different pH\
across this barrier.\
So, if these ideas are correct, then it immediately explains why Bacteria\
and Archaea independently have the same properties: that they\'92re using the\
membrane to react hydrogen and carbon dioxide to make organic\
molecules.\
Even plants are reacting hydrogen with carbon dioxide: it doesn\'92t look\
like it, because what they are doing is stripping the hydrogen from water\'97\
they\'92re using the energy of the sun to split water, grab the hydrogen and do\
what these cells always did\'97and the waste is the oxygen that gets washed\
out into the atmosphere.\
Again, this is a fundamental principle of what life is doing: it\'92s using\
carbon dioxide and attaching hydrogen onto it. It\'92s getting that hydrogen\
from wherever it can now but in the beginning it was just bubbling out of\
the ground.\
So you have a cell, which is basically growing because of proton\
gradients across membranes, and these same constraints should apply to life\
anywhere else.\
It\'92s imaginable that life could operate in a different way, but because\
these conditions are so common\'97indeed ubiquitous\'97it\'92s likely that you\
would have similar constraints on life arising on other planets for similar\
reasons.\
And then, you\'92re going to get stuck, because the problem with respiring\
across the membrane is that you run into two sets of constraints.\
One of them is just a geometric issue related to surface area. If you\'92re\
breathing across your skin, then the amount of energy you can get depends\
on the surface area of your skin, whereas the amount of proteins you need\
to make to be an active, working cell depends on the volume; and as you\
become a larger and larger cell the surface area falls in relation to the\
volume.\
So, there are constraints there. Now, why can\'92t you \'93internalize\'94 the\
situation and get out of those constraints, as we do with our mitochondria?\
And the answer there seems to be that what you have are membranes\
with a charge across the membrane\'97the proton gradient is a charge, and\
it\'92s a very strong charge. If you get down to the level of the membrane\
itself, it\'92s about 30 million volts per meter\'97that\'92s the field strength that you\
\page would experience if you were the size of a molecule down there, which is\
equivalent to a bolt of lightning.\
In all of our cells, then, the membranes have a charge across them\
equivalent to a bolt of lightning; and that\'92s what\'92s really keeping us alive\'97\
it\'92s gone back generation after generation, right back to the very origins of\
life. It\'92s a thrilling thought, really.\
So how do you keep a charge with that intensity from doing damage?\
Well, the answer seems to be, By responding in a, kind of, thermostat-\
type way to any changes in the intensity of the charge or the conditions that\
generate or dissipate the charge\'97and we have to react within minutes,\
usually.\
So if you put a plastic bag over your head, you\'92re going to be dead in a\
couple of minutes. If you had a partial plastic bag over your head, maybe\
you would survive\'97but if you survive, it\'92s because you\'92re adapting to the\
changing conditions; and again, you had better do it quickly.\
All diving mammals adapt very quickly to having oxygen cut off, and it\
seems to take genes right on site\'97it\'92s as if there\'92s a requirement for a sort\
of \'93local management centre\'94 to organize on the ground. You could see it in\
military terms: a local commander on the ground responding to changes in\
the immediate circumstances.\
So this seems to be the real problem: we have inside ourselves these\
mitochondria\'97they started out as Bacteria, they had whole genomes,\
bacterial-sized genomes, of probably four or five thousand genes; and they\
got whittled away over two billion years and down to just a handful of\
genes left.\
But we all have that same handful of genes left: we do, plants do, fungi\
do\'97basically all of complex life has two genomes, not one genome: the\
massive, nuclear genome, which codes for all the complexity, but that\
massive genome is supported by these tiny genomes in the mitochondria.\
And if you were to strip those genomes out, then effectively, the cell\
would lose control over its own energy and be unable to maintain its own\
nucleus.\
So, the hypothesis is that you cannot have complex life with massive\
genomes unless it\'92s supported by these tiny, pared-back, bioenergenetic\
genomes.\
\page HB: OK, so if I understand the story correctly, the idea is that at one point\
some bacteria was swallowed, as it were, by an archaean cell and eventually\
became mitochondria, thereby creating a new type of cell\'97a eukaryotic\
cell\'97that allowed all of these other complex structures to develop.\
I can see that there are energy considerations and so forth, but one\
obvious question is, How often did this happen?\
My recollection is that, according to theoretical arguments, this only\
happened once around 2.5 billion years in. I can sort of see how all sorts of\
interesting developments can take place after that point, but that certainly\
strikes me as curious, and I\'92m left wondering, How did that happen? And,\
relatedly, Why only once? Maybe, somehow, those sorts of processes are\
happening all over the place.\
NL: Well, I think we need to take a step back and ask, What are we trying\
to explain here? Most people\'92s immediate perception is exactly that, "It\
happened once, that\'92s outrageous, it cannot possibly be true, it\'92s too much\
of a freak fluke\'94.\
HB: I didn\'92t say it couldn\'92t be true; it just strikes me as requiring some sort\
of an explanation.\
NL: Well, as human beings, we back away from that proposition; and I\
think it means that we tend not to look at the evidence in an even-handed\
way.\
So what\'92s the evidence? I have to say that it\'92s weak, but what do we\
have? Well, what we see is that we are all very closely related to the plants\
outside our windows at the level of our cells, at the level of our genes in\
thousands upon thousands of ways. We undoubtedly share a common\
ancestor\'97and, by definition, that common ancestor can only have arisen\
once.\
The first thing, then, is that we look at all this complex life around the\
world and we find that it all shares that same cell structure\'97which is odd,\
because what I would expect from first principles, would be that plants, for\
example, would have arisen from photosynthetic bacteria and I would have\
arisen from some kind of bacterium that went around eating things and a\
fungi would have a arisen from another type of bacteria that went around\
dissolving the matrix that it lived in.\
\page But that\'92s not what happened: we all go back to a single, common\
ancestor\'97and as I say, by definition, it arose once, and it\'92s very difficult to\
track what happened before that ancestor.\
So, we share all of this complexity with all these other things and\
Bacteria don\'92t and Archaea don\'92t and we\'92ve spent a lot of time looking in\
all kinds of environments. It wouldn\'92t be very surprising to find another\
type of cell which is not like either the eukaryotic cell or either of the two\
known prokaryotic groups.\
But we\'92ve spent an awful lot of time looking and we\'92ve really not found\
anything that we can agree about.\
HB: Wasn\'92t there some weird thing that was found near Japan?\
NL: Yes, there\'92s one weird thing in the sea off the coast of Japan and all\
we\'92ve got is one section of that cell, which killed the cell, of course. So we\
don\'92t have any genome, we don\'92t know what it is.\
I finished the book with a discussion of that and what it might mean, but\
it doesn\'92t really take away from this problem that all complex life that we\
know about shares this common ancestor\'97which, by definition, arose once.\
It arose, we think, about 2 billion years ago. So, the first thing you might\
say is, \'93Let\'92s scrutinize the fossil record before that; is there any evidence at\
all that there were other origins of complex life?\'94\
Now, there is plenty of bacteria in that fossil record, but there\'92s no sign of\
more complex cells. Now, it may just be that they didn\'92t fossilize very well,\
but we do see them later on.\
From about a billion years ago, we see unequivocal eukaryotic cells\'97we\
see fungi, we see red algae\'97so some of these groups do fossilize just fine,\
it\'92s just that we don\'92t see them for the first 2-2.5 billion years of earth\'92s\
history.\
Then we do start seeing some things, but we\'92re not sure what they are.\
They\'92re probably eukaryotic, but we don\'92t know. It\'92s possible that there\
were multiple origins at that time of complex cells that disappeared, a lot of\
them, but we don\'92t really know. So there\'92s an uncertainty there.\
And ever since then, the assumption is, \'93Well, now there are these\
complex, eukaryotic cells that have taken over the whole world and they\'92re\
going to eat everything else, so any bacteria that is striving to be a little bit\
bigger, a little bit more complex, is just going to be eaten before it ever has\
a chance to get very far\'94.\
\page That is a bit of a limp assumption. It might be true, but we do know of\
thousands of different cells, which are a kind of intermediate level of\
complexity and they do just fine; but they\'92ve all evolved down to that level,\
they\'92ve all become simpler from more complex eukaryotic ancestors, rather\
than evolving up to that niche from simpler, bacterial ones.\
So, I think what I would say is that it\'92s a bit of a complacent assumption\
that it must have happened thousands or millions of times, because there\'92s\
not a jot of evidence for it. All I\'92m trying to explain, really, is what the\
evidence says at face value, which is that it happened once.\
Now, I think that\'92s an extreme view; I would be shocked if it happened\
only once\'97it probably happened thousands of times, millions of times,\
who knows? The thing is, it only survived once; it only took over the world\
on one occasion.\
So, why? Well, I think this takes us back to, Why is life the way it is?\
All these cells have these particular traits; and the argument is that those\
traits arise because selection has switched from being about the outside\
world to being about the inside world: how do you survive with your\
bacteria population living inside you?\
There are two aspects to this.\
One of them is that it\'92s really not easy for a bacterium to get inside\
another bacterium. We know of some examples, so we know it\'92s possible,\
but it\'92s rare. So, this is part one of the bottleneck, if you like: that it doesn\'92t\
happen much.\
Part two of the bottleneck is that, once it\'92s happened you end up with an\
extremely unstable cell, which is likely to go wrong and likely to die.\
And an argument of the book is that trying to reconcile these\
relationships between the cell and this population of bacteria living inside\
leads to a whole host of traits: that\'92s why we end up with two sexes, why\
we age and die and so on. All of these traits can all be traced back to that\
relationship.\
So perhaps there have been several other origins of complex life on earth\
that just never really got a footing. I hesitate to say that it\'92s as rare as it\
appears to be, but what I would say with some conviction is that just having\
a population of bacteria on a planet is no guarantee that you\'92re going to end\
up with complex life.\
There\'92s a point at which the mode of evolution shifts and it seems to\
require an endosymbiosis\'97one cell getting inside another one\'97for reasons\
\page that I think relate to energy and go back to the very origin of life; and that\
this happening, in itself, constrains the properties that complex life is going\
to have.\
So, this is the overall thrust of the argument and it may be that it all falls\
down tomorrow because a single discovery could overturn a lot of this.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	What part of Nick\'92s argument would be reinforced if we were\
to discover a new form of bacteria on Mars tomorrow?\
2.	To what extent is it possible to meaningfully assess the\
probability of eukaryotic cells arising from the process of\
endosymbiosis given our current state of knowledge?\
3.	What might be a mechanism to explain the \'93whittling away\'94\
of the original bacterium genome that eventually became the\
smaller mitochondrial genome that Nick refers to in this\
chapter?\
\page VII.	Marvellous Mitochondria\
Insights from a metabolic worldview\
HB: So once again I\'92m forced to preface my comments by explicitly saying\
that I don\'92t pretend to know anything about this, but it seems to me that this\
is the sort of thing that might be somehow modelled, trying to assess the\
likelihood for one sort of scenario over another.\
Of course particularly in the beginning a lot would be thrown in by hand,\
but you could certainly imagine in principle running various models based\
upon these constraints and coming up with various probabilities of\
eukaryotic cells happening once every three billion years or something like\
that.\
NL: You could certainly model all of that, yes. I think you would have\
considerable doubt about the value of the many parameters that you would\
chose for the model.\
It would be an interesting thing to try to do, however, and I think one of\
the best things about modelling is not so much that it necessarily gives you\
an answer that you can believe, so much as it makes you think about the\
question in a far more rigorous way regarding what the specific parts are\
and how they interact with each other.\
We\'92ve actually done quite a lot of modelling about questions such as the\
origin of two sexes: why it is that one sex passes on the mitochondria and\
the other one doesn\'92t?\
And, to me, there have been some revelations which come from the\
mathematical modelling of these questions and thinking in rigorous terms:\
You've got this population of cells that are mutating; we know that they\
mutate, how fast do they mutate? What happens if you have a mutation rate\
ofx? How does the host cell cope with that?\
It turns out that some very simple answers come out from that, in the end.\
Effectively, it\'92s all about how you keep those mitochondria under control so\
that they\'92re doing a job for you rather than doing their own thing. How do\
you select for their function so that they are continually being helpful?\
And the answer is that you\'92ve got to mix things up. If you\'92re a cell and\
you\'92re dividing into daughter cells, what you have to make sure is that some\
of the daughter cells get different selections of mitochondria.\
\page One type might be good for you, one might be bad for you, there might\
be a mixture in the middle, but what you\'92re doing is that you\'92re\
apportioning them out into cells that can then compete between themselves\
as cells\'97these guys have the good mitochondria, and those guys have the\
bad ones, so the first guys are going to win the battle.\
And that\'92s a way of selecting, at the level of mitochondria, that the\
population inside you has got the good mitochondria. And the only way you\
can do that\'97given that you\'92re constantly throwing up new mutations and\
new \'93bad\'94 mitochondria\'97is to sample, in one way or another\'97constantly\
passing out and allocating different types of mitochondria. And that\'92s\
what\'92s happening when you have two sexes: only one sex is passing on the\
mitochondria, which is a form of sampling.\
They\'92re doing it, again, in oocytes in the female germline\'97they\'92re\
passing them out through a series of randomizing processes that mean that\
all the different oocytes are getting slightly different populations of\
mitochondria. Some of them will work well, some of them won\'92t work\
well. The ones that don\'92t work well will more likely than not be killed off,\
while the ones that do work well will go on to seed the next generation.\
So there are insights coming from the mathematical modelling of a very\
simple process of generating variation by segregation, by doubling and\
apportioning out randomly. I think these are valuable insights, but to try and\
put a number on how long that\'92s going to take is very difficult, because we\
don\'92t have enough insight into what the real parameter values actually are.\
HB: OK. I\'92d like to back up a bit to a higher level, returning to this idea of\
this key, overarching, recognition of the importance of appreciating the\
value of proton gradients across membranes. Perhaps I\'92m just a very easily-\
influenced fellow, but this strikes me as an important observation that every\
life form that we see around us works that way at the cellular level.\
That\'92s very suggestive to me of something very much like a principle.\
Now it\'92s possible you might say that my physics background makes me\
\'93unduly principle-obsessed\'94 or something, and I suppose it\'92s logically\
possible that it\'92s some sort of a coincidence somehow, but to me, at least it\'92s\
certainly suggestive of something pretty important. After all, if you see the\
same thing at the heart of all life forms all over the place, it seems to me\
that you be rather remiss if you don\'92t ask yourself, Wow, that's odd, why is it\
that way?\
\page So I\'92m just wondering if, at the highest level\'97without going into all\
sorts of details or corroborating specific predictions with various\
mathematical models\'97or even, for that matter, going into the question of\
hydrothermal vents as a concrete mechanism for the generation of this\
mechanism\'97is the basic recognition of the seeming universality of this\
proton gradient membrane energy mechanism for life gaining wider\
currency amongst biologists? Do they see it somehow as a natural\
consequence of more fundamental principles or ideas? Or is this something\
that most people in the field just somehow ignore?\
NL: I would say yes, it is gaining wider currency, but I think it\'92s had a\
trivial effect on the overall direction of, let\'92s say, medical research. And\
that\'92s for understandable reasons, which is to say that we have tremendous\
processing power now and reading genes and reading variations in genes\
has been tremendously important and successful. And lot of the biology that\
I talk about in the book has come from genetics and has come from reading\
genomes.\
HB: Of course. Maybe I didn\'92t ask the right question; I\'92m not suggesting\
that someone who is a cancer researcher just drop everything and start\
doing something else.\
NL: Well, actually a lot of cancer researchers are thinking in terms of\
metabolism now; and the field has gone, over the last 10 or 15 years or so,\
away from the idea that it\'92s just mutations in genes\'97that it\'92s oncogenes or\
tumour-suppressive genes\'97and people are thinking far more openly in\
terms of epigenetic changes, in terms of genomic stability, in terms of\
what\'92s known as the \'93Warburg effect\'94, that cells will switch their\
metabolism away from respiring oxygen\'97which they still do, to some\
extent\'97relying on fermentation processes instead.\
I think these ideas are more mainstream than they were\'97and a lot of\
what I\'92ve written about is not specific to cancer in any particular way\'97but\
the point I\'92m making is that we have this tremendous ability to read the\
genomes of cells, even single cancer cells, but I think the field is trying to\
work out why the genes are being expressed in some particular way; and\
there\'92s now an understanding that, underpinning that, is something about\
the metabolic status of the cell.\
\page And when it comes to the metabolic status of the cell, from my point of\
view\'97since I\'92m convinced that the origin of the eukaryotic cell was about\
the relationship between two cell types, one of them was the mitochondria\
and one of them was the host cell, and that all this eukaryotic complexity\
arose in that context\'97the mitochondria, are, almost necessarily, right at the\
heart of all of that.\
Now, medical research over the last couple of decades has found\
repeatedly, as I was finding back in the days when I was working for the\
medical education agency, that free radical biochemistry is central to these\
things.\
A lot of the free radical biochemistry is coming from the mitochondria;\
and, actually, at the broader level, it\'92s the mitochondria that are central to\
everything. This has been found repeatedly in one disease after another: that\
mitochondria are potentially important.\
Now, a balanced medical researcher is going to say, \'93Okay, well yes,\
they're one part of a cell, plainly, they're important: they're important for\
apoptosis, this controlled cell death, they're important for providing ATP,\
they're important for other things too, but let's not lose our bearings here,\
there are other cell structures too, most genes are in the nucleus, and the\
endoplasmic reticulum is very important as well." So a balanced, reasonable\
view will naturally try not to over-emphasize the importance of\
mitochondria.\
But this evolutionary view, which says that mitochondria are right at the\
centre of everything and everything that a cell does, brushes all the rest of\
that aside somewhat, and says, \'93No, the answer really does lie here; and the\
reason that mitochondria keep cropping up is not because they're just part\
of a cell, it's because they're absolutely central to everything a cell is\
doing".\
I don\'92t think that attitude has been really carried across yet, but maybe it\
will eventually.\
HB: In some of your talks, you quote Erwin Schr\'f6dinger and his approach\
outlined in his influential book What is Life?, trying to focus on the\
necessary aspect of everything that we call life, and my sense is that a large\
part of your approach is trying to answer that question in your own way.\
So again, I\'92m not suggesting that every medical researcher should drop\
what she is doing, but it seems to me that this is very suggestive of a big-\
\page picture approach to the biological sciences and I\'92m wondering what\
somebody who disagrees with you would say on that level, rather than those\
who would argue that other things are also important\'97or more important in\
certain circumstances\'97which I\'92m sure is an argument that can be\
successfully made.\
Again, I\'92m looking at things more from the perspective of, say,\
appreciating the necessary conditions for life writ large: considering what\
would be required for life, broadly defined, to occur on exoplanets say, as\
you mentioned earlier.\
So I\'92m wondering what people who are also thinking about those sorts of\
things but disagree with you might say.\
NL: I think there are fields where people really would disagree with me. For\
example, the origin of the eukaryotic cell: was it an abrupt shift in selective\
forces operating on it, or was it a gradual accumulation of complexity?\
They would have quite strong arguments against my position. And the same\
goes for the origin of life.\
Now, for this area of medical research, I don\'92t think that there is a strong\
argument against it so much as it\'92s just ignored, because the assumption is\
that it\'92s all about DNA, it\'92s all about sequence changes.\
As I say, that\'92s now beginning to shift, but generally speaking there\'92s not\
yet a widespread determination to consider matters from the point of view\
of there being a necessary interplay between energy and genes and structure\
\'97that cell physiology depends on that interplay of energy flow through a\
cell at any time, and that the epigenetic state of genes, whether they\'92re\
switched on or silenced, once again depends on that energy flow.\
Now, I don\'92t think I\'92m saying things here which many people would\
disagree with, it\'92s just not a focus: it\'92s just not the way that people really\
approach the problem.\
On various occasions I\'92ve tried to think through logically, Does it point\
in a different direction to the direction that medical research is currently\
taking? And I can\'92t say that it really does. I can\'92t say that the people who\
are studying cancer from a metabolism point of view and looking at\
genomic instability are doing anything other than what I would recommend\
that they do.\
But I think there are other whole areas of medical research where that\
might be different. For example, we know about hereditary diseases: lots of\
\page diseases have a heritability. And that may be, very high.\
So I\'92m making up numbers here, but let\'92s say for schizophrenia or\
epilepsy, there\'92s a heritability of 50%, which means, in the case of identical\
twins, if one twin has it, there\'92s a 50% chance that the other twin would\
have it.\
So, obviously, a lot of it is nothing to do with genes and heredity, but for\
the 50% that is to do, apparently, with genes and heredity\'97what is it\
exactly?\
The way that people tend to go about these questions is by looking at\
what are known as genome-wide association studies: you go across the\
entire genome and you look for people who\'92ve got a genetic variant of a\
particular gene and you say, \'93Oh, look, these two people have this and both\
of them have got epilepsy or schizophrenia or something\'94, so there\'92s an\
association here with this variant of this particular gene.\
Now, most diseases have nothing to do with a single gene\'97we know that\
lots of genes play a role\'97and so you look for all these \'93SNPs,\'94 they call\
them (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), and you effectively add up the\
amount of heredity that these SNPs can account for. Typically, it might add\
up to 2% or 3%, and so there\'92s the thing known as the \'93missing heredity,\'94\
which is the other 30% or 40% which is not explained by these genome-\
wide association studies.\
Now the thing that frustrates me is that, very often, people will say,\
\'93Well, we don\'92t have enough resolution, there weren\'92t enough patients in\
this study; and if we make a bigger study that\'92s 10 times as big then we\'92re\
going to pick up on a whole lot more associations that didn\'92t show up in this\
one\'94.\
But logically, that still can\'92t account for more than a few percent of the\
total associations. Other things could be heritable. For example,\
environment is heritable to a degree\'97we have a microbiome, which is\
different from what people in Japan have\'97it\'92s to do with a European diet\
and so on and that is heritable, in some sense, through the conditions in\
which we live. And that could, theoretically, account for a large part of it.\
But we also have mitochondrial genes and their interaction with the\
nuclear background, and that also could arguably account for that \'93missing\
heredity\'94. The frustrating thing is that people very rarely look: they tend to\
put aside the mitochondrial genes as being trivial and unimportant\
\page housekeeping genes because there\'92s only 38 of them against 20,000 in the\
nucleus, and so they conclude that they cannot possibly be important.\
So, they put it aside and don\'92t look\'97and I find that a frustration, because\
it\'92s not so much that there\'92s an argument against it, so much as there\'92s just\
an ignorance or a lack of interest in the logical possibility that something\
other than the gene sequence in the nucleus accounts for a large proportion\
of the missing, genetic, heritability of diseases, and therefore could give\
insights into it.\
HB: Perhaps another way to say this is that this lack of interest is related to\
a lack of appreciation of function and evolutionary history rather than mere\
numbers and statistics. I mean, if you just look at the numbers, as you were\
saying, it\'92s natural to conclude, \'93Well, there are only 38 over here compared\
to thousands over here so let\'92s concentrate on those\'94. But that implies a\
fundamental equivalence between them all. And if you look at it\
functionally, and you ask, What do these things actually do? or perhaps\
better still, Why are they there at all? it\'92s a different matter altogether.\
NL: Yes. So these are, in a sense, more philosophical questions about why\
the cell is the way it is and why life is the way it is, and it guides you to\
thinking that the interaction between the genes in the mitochondria and the\
genes in the nucleus has to be central to the existence of cells at all; and\
therefore, if it starts going wrong for whatever reason, then there will be\
consequences\'97and those consequences will be diseases: they will be the\
things that go wrong in our own lives.\
Once again, then, this broad, synoptic view channels down and says,\
\'9377ze answer to the problem is here somewhere.\'94 Maybe the details of what\
I\'92ve suggested are all wrong, but the answer has to lie in there somewhere:\
it has to be important.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	To what extent is our understanding of genetics sufficient to\
understand human diversity? In what ways might this\
understanding depend on factors that can\'92t be immediately\
determined from examining the DNA? (Readers interested in\
this issue are referred to Chapters 7-10 of Our Human\
Variability with geneticist Stephen Scherer.)\
2.	Under what circumstances can an invocation of statistical\
arguments actually hinder our comprehension of vital\
underlying mechanisms at play?\
\page VIII.	Open Questions\
From the origin of life to consciousness\
HB: I\'92d like to conclude with a question that I often ask people of a\
scientific disposition, which is, If I were an omniscient being and could\
answer any three questions that you might have, what would you ask me?\
NL: Well, I think the first one would be about the origin of life: Was it\
really this way? These vents for these reasons?\
The second one would be, I suppose, about eukaryotes and complexity:\
Was it really about energy? Was it really about the requirement for cells\
interacting?\
I mean, there\'92s a lot in these ideas, but they may be completely wrong\
and they may be a figment of my imagination. Science has a knack of\
leading you up the garden path, and it turns out that a lot of things that you\
became attached to and cherished are actually just wrong, so I would like to\
know the answer to those.\
The third one, I think, is perhaps a more rounded, human question, and\
that\'92s about the origin of consciousness. I wrote an earlier book called Life\
Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution, and there\'92s a chapter in\
there on consciousness.\
It\'92s not a subject that I\'92m an expert on at all, but it\'92s a subject that really\
had to be in that book; and I\'92ve had more abusive emails from people about\
that chapter than anything else.\
HB: Oh, really?\
NL: I mean, not terribly abusive, but saying things like, ''\'91Why are you\
addressing a subject you're obviously not an expert in?\'94\
HB: Well, you also wrote a paper once and concluded with words to the\
effect of, "The quantum effects of consciousness are too important to be left\
up to the speculations of physicists". I was wondering if you got any nasty\
responses to that as well.\
NL: Not really, actually; the physicists quite engaged with that. I had emails\
from Stuart Kauffman and Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose in response\
\page to that paper, and I would stand by what I said there.\
So I\'92m not an expert on it, but I think that biochemistry, as a discipline,\
has avoided the problem; and the problem is a very simple one to me, which\
is that we know how neurons operate\'97by iron gradients across membranes,\
funnily enough, the same mechanism.\
And they depolarize: membranes will open up pores in them and sodium\
or potassium irons will go rushing through, depolarizing the membrane.\
Somehow that gives rise to feelings, somehow, the fact that this membrane\
just changed its physical state means that I experience love or I experience\
pain or hate or just bellyache.\
I do believe that it\'92s in the biochemistry, I do believe that there\'92s\
something in there to explain\'97I don\'92t want to resort to the idea that it\'92s a\
mysterious thing and God did it. Perhaps he did, I don\'92t know; but I\'92d like\
to think that a scientific explanation would be grounded in the chemistry\
that we know about.\
I\'92m left thinking, at the end of all of this\'97and I\'92ve read a lot, I read a lot\
of books and I thought a lot about it\'97that someone else would have an\
answer to that simple question of how depolarization of a neuron gives rise\
to a thought or a feeling of anything at all; and I don\'92t think anyone has ever\
answered that question.\
I can only think of two ways into answering the question.\
One is from fundamental physics, going back to the Roger Penrose view\
of things that there really is a missing property of matter that we don\'92t know\
anything about, and if we can understand that, then we will get an insight\
into what consciousness is.\
I find it hard to swallow that there is a fundamental property of matter\
which relates to the grim reality of life\'97pain or stomach ache or whatever\
it might be\'97and it doesn\'92t seem to correspond to the anatomy of the brain\
to me either. Now, maybe it does; I don\'92t have that as a strong view.\
The alternative, though, is that it is all about the structure of the brain and\
it has nothing to do with the fundamental property of matter, and that,\
somehow, depolarization of neurons is able to give rise to a feeling and that\
we can find out what that is\'97but, in effect, selection has been operating.\
Selection has basically fooled us, tricked us; and it\'92s made us think that\
these feelings are real, when, in fact, they\'92re not: they\'92re just properties of\
the nervous system operating\'97it\'92s an emergent property of a nervous\
\page system. Those are words that mean almost nothing to me, but that\'92s the\
context in which it\'92s seen.\
So, I have no idea about consciousness. The origin of life, I can see a way\
through the problems; I have some difficulty with self-organization of\
matter, but basically, I can see a path through the whole problem that may\
or may not be right, but it\'92s not beyond the wits of man to solve that\
problem, it\'92s not beyond my wits to solve that problem.\
Consciousness, I see as very different: it\'92s beyond my wits to solve it and\
so far, from what I\'92ve read, it\'92s beyond the wits of man, at the moment as\
well\'97and that\'92s a thrilling problem for a rising generation of scientists to\
get their teeth into.\
HB: Indeed. Is there anything that you\'92d like add? Is there something we\'92ve\
overlooked or haven\'92t covered sufficiently?\
NL: Not really. I could talk all day, but I think finishing on consciousness is\
good, because that\'92s a problem that I have no personal investment in really,\
but I think it\'92s one of the great, scientific problems that we still have not\
gotten close to solving.\
HB: Well, thank you very much, Nick. It\'92s been a pleasure.\
NL: Agreed. You\'92re very welcome.\
\page Questions for Discussion:\
1.	To what extent are researchers naturally prone to regard all\
phenomena around them as manifestations of the same\
mechanisms that they are most familiar with?\
2.	Will we ever have a comprehensive understanding of\
consciousness?\
