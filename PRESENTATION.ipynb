      "The park embodies contemporary China at its tawdriest. [0] Many cities around the world have city bike and city car systems, allowing visitors or residents to use a vehicle for a short period of time. [1] And until the advent of outdoor cinema in Melbourne, that meant staying inside at the best time of the day. [2] The end report also recommended extending meter hours, and only allowing cars to park for four hours. [3] Strictly speaking the city is an immense park Its lay out furnishes a multitude of architectural aspects of infinitely varying forms. [4] Runge proved that he could identify the presence of henbane, belladonna and thorn apple in one of a number of bottles, by dropping the suspect solutions into a cat’s eye. [5] Fields of LEDs began to take over and transform the roles of the movie poster, the theater marquee, the billboard, the cornice inscription, and even the entire urban facade. [6] In this way the district round the skyscraper is cleared. [7] Competing for this chicken and white wine market is the newer OpenAir cinema at Birrarung Mar, a fabulous park by the river in the city. [8] The skyscraper has reestablished the pedestrian, him alone.... [9] The Formula One car effectively became a real time control system—a loop with both sensing and actuating components. [10] Cleaner engines, therefore, might reduce emissions; they also encourage us to increase car usage. [11] In combination with the refrigerator and the automobile, the supermarket changed shopping habits. [12] Some people worry that car share might undermine public transportation, taxis, walking, or biking, but the opposite is true. [13] It makes copyable documents and home cinema film. [14] \n",
