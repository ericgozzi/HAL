[0] At its heart was a park or green. [1] Fields of LEDs began to take over and transform the roles of the movie poster, the theater marquee, the billboard, the cornice inscription, and even the entire urban facade. [2] The Formula One car effectively became a real time control system—a loop with both sensing and actuating components. [3] The mall is anchored by a supermarket where all of the exotic luxuries of home—cheese, bread, and breakfast cereal—can be had at a shocking markup. [4] Each park was lovingly tended by the locals, who quietly tilled their patches, or otherwise sat around, chatting and welcoming me in to share their pride. [5] The early portion of home to work trips were full of vivid pictures of the flower and trees. [6] The cinema is transparent, with no pretension, a super modern space. [7] The end report also recommended extending meter hours, and only allowing cars to park for four hours. [8] Anyone can do it a skyscraper based on the Chinese pagoda and/or a Tuscan hill town. [9] The city fosters art and is art; the city creates the theater and is the theater. [10] And finally a theater for two hundred and forty spectators. [11] Competing for this chicken and white wine market is the newer OpenAir cinema at Birrarung Mar, a fabulous park by the river in the city. [12] Some people worry that car share might undermine public transportation, taxis, walking, or biking, but the opposite is true. [13] Perhaps the gloss of a beckoning fruit obliterates and outshines any blemishes that, the apple once eaten into and its core now perching exposed on the sideboard, conspire to make it look rotten, or if not rotten then at the very least spotted with flaws.
